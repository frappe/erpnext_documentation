# Terms And Conditions

**Terms and conditions contain the terms and conditions of a service/product offered by a seller to a buyer.**

Each Quotation/Sales Order must ideally contain a set of terms of your contract. Terms and conditions are usually included to define terms of service, conditions for using any service or to even limit responsibilities of the seller in case any harm is caused to the buyer due to using the provided goods or services.  It is
usually a good idea to make template(s) of your Terms and Conditions so that
you have a standard set of terms. 

To access Terms and Conditions template go to:
