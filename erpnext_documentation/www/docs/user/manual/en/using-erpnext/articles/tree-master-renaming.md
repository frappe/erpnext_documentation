# Tree Master Renaming

**There are various documents in ERPNext which are maintained in a tree structure.**

Read about [managing tree structures](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/articles/managing-tree-structure-masters.html) to learn more.

Following are the steps to be followed for renaming the ID of a master which is maintained in a tree structure. Let's rename an Account for the instance.

* **Step 1:** Go to the Tree View of the Document

* **Step 2:** Go to the node of the Document which you wish to rename

 When you click on that node, you will have an option to 'Rename' the document.
