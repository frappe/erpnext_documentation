All **GL Entries** can be exported in DATEV-Format for your tax advisor.

## DATEV-Format

The german DATEV eG is a registered cooperative of the tax, accountancy and legal professions. The DATEV format is a CSV-based file interface for importing data into DATEV Accounting. The interface documentation is available in the DATEV developer portal:

- [DATEV format v7.0](https://developer.datev.de/portal/system/files/files/book/datev_format_v7.0.zip).

## Prerequisites

To use the DATEV Export, these need to be created first:

- [DATEV Settings](/docs/user/manual/en/regional/germany/datev-settings)

## Filters

In the filters section you can choose the company whose **GL Entries** you want to export. You can also set the timeframe for the export. Usually this will be the last month.

## Menu

From the menu you can open the [DATEV Settings](/docs/user/manual/en/regional/germany/datev-settings) or download the export file. The export file is a ZIP archive that contains the transaction data from the preview as well as master data (**Customers**, **Suppliers**, **Accounts**).

## Exported Data

Currently, you can export **GL Entries** in the way ERPNext creates them. For example, booking a **Sales Invoice** will result in three **GL Entries**:

| Debit amount | Credit amount | Account | Against         |
|--------------|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| Gross amount |               | Debtors | Revenue Account |
|              | Tax amount    | Tax     | Customer        |
|              | Net amount    | Sales   | Customer        |

However, in ERPNext the right side is not necessarily an **Account**. It could also be multiple accounts, a **Customer** or a **Supplier**. Therefore, we use a temporary against account that can be specified in [DATEV Settings](/docs/user/manual/en/regional/germany/datev-settings). All GL Entries are made against this account. The rows in the DATEV Export will look something like this:

| Amount       | Debit or Credit | Account | Against Account |
|--------------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|
| Gross amount | Debit           | Debtors | Temporary       |
| Tax amount   | Credit          | Tax     | Temporary       |
| Net amount   | Credit          | Sales   | Temporary       |

> Please consult your tax advisor about if and how you can use this data.
