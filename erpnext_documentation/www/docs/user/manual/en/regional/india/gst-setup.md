# GST Features in ERPNext

### 1. Setting up GSTIN

GST Law requires that you maintain the GSTIN number for all your suppliers and vendors. In ERPNext, GSTIN is linked to the **Address**

**GST for your Company Address**

You also need to set the Address for your own Company and your Company's GST Number

Go to the Company master and add the GSTIN to your default address.

### 2. Setting up HSN Codes

According to the GST Law, your itemised invoices must contain the HSN Code related to that Item. ERPNext comes pre-installed with all 12,000+ HSN Codes so that you can easily select the relevant HSN Code in your Item

### 3. Making Tax Masters

To setup Billing in GST, you need to create 3 Tax Accounts for the various GST reporting heads CGST - Central GST, SGST - State GST, IGST - Inter-state GST

Go to your **Chart of Accounts**, under the Duties and Taxes head of your account, create 3 Accounts

**Note:** Usually the rate in CGST and SGST is half of IGST. For example if most of your items are billed at 18%, then create IGST at 18%, CGST and SGST at 9% each.

### 4. Add GST Accounts in GST Settings

Add all the GST Accounts in GST Settings. Adding these accounts in GST Settings will help the system identify all the GST accounts and generate GST reports.

You can also enable the "Round Off GST Values" in case you want to round off individual GST components in the invoices.
