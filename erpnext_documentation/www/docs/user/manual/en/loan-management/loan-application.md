# Loan Application
> Introduced in Version 13

**A Loan Application contains details about the applicant and loan security details for review.**

During a loan process, the first step a customer or employee has to do is submit a Loan Application for review. In case of a secured loan, a Loan Application can also contain proposed loan securities.

### 3.1 Creating the Loan Security Pledge
A [Loan Security Pledge](/docs/user/manual/en/loan-management/loan-security-pledge) based on the proposed securities can be created from the Loan Application itself via **Create** button on the top right. This Loan Security Pledge can then be pledged against a loan as an initial Loan Security Pledge.
