# Contract

**A contract is a legally binding agreement between a Supplier and a Customer over the sale or products or services.**

A contract is legally enforceable because it meets the requirements and approval of the law. An agreement typically involves the exchange of goods, services, money, or promises of any of those.

### 2.5 Contract Template
A contract template is a standardized outline of a contract without the specifics involved. You can create a new template by going to:

> Home > CRM > Contract Template

You can create templates by using Jinja. Eg:

```
The parties enter into this contract on {{ start_date }}.
```

When you create a new contract using this template, the `{{ start_date }}` is replaced by the date entered into the field of the same name.
