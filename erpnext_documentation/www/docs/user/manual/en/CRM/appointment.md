It'll match the customer email with leads in the system and if one is found, it is linked with the document.
If no lead is found, the appointment is marked as "Unverified" and an email is sent to the customer to confirm their email

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Autoassign

Appointments are automatically assigned to employees as per the `Agents` list in [Appointment Booking Settings](/docs/user/manual/en/CRM/appointment-booking-settings). The agent with the least number of assignments for the day of the appointment and who is free in the scheduled time is assigned to the appointment.

### 3.2 Email confirmation

If there is no matching lead in your system, an email will be sent to the email address in the appointment to confirm if the email address is valid. Upon confirmation, a new Lead will also be created in the system along with the Appointment.
