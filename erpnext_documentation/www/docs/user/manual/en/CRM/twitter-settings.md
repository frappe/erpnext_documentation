Twitter related settings like OAuth can be configured here. ERPNext needs access to the API through which the post is shared and achieved using OAuth 2.0 Authentication Protocol.

You must have Twitter App for your company. ERPNext interacts with this App for sharing Tweet. 

### 1.1 Create Twitter Developer App
