### 2.1 Tag Campaign in Lead, Opportunity, and Quotation

When a marketing campaign generates a lead or an opportunity, you can tag the campaign while creating the [Lead](/docs/user/manual/en/CRM/lead) or [Opportunity](/docs/user/manual/en/CRM/opportunity). You can also tag the campaign in [Quotation](/docs/user/manual/en/selling/quotation).

This helps in assessing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign by calculating the return on investment.
