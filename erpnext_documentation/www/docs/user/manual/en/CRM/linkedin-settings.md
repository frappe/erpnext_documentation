# LinkedIn Settings

LinkedIn related settings like OAuth can be configured here. ERPNext needs access to the API through which the post is shared and achieved using OAuth 2.0 Authentication Protocol.

## 1. How to set up LinkedIn Developer App

You must have LinkedIn Developer App for your company. ERPNext interacts with this App for sharing the post.

### 1.1 Create LinkedIn Developer App

Create App by link `https://www.linkedin.com/developers` fill all the details and verify it. And that App has the following products.

1. Share on LinkedIn
2. Sign In with LinkedIn
3. Marketing Developer Platform
