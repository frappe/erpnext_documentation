## 2. Status of the Contributed Translation

After you submit your translation, it will be queued for verification. A member of the Frappe team/community will validate the contributed translation and set the status as **Verified** if the translation is **correct**. If the contributed translation is **incorrect**, the member of the Frappe team/community will reject that contributed translation.

Every week the translation server will create a **Pull Request** containing all the **verified translations** that were contributed.
