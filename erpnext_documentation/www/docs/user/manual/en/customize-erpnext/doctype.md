# DocType

**A DocType is the core building block of any application based on the Frappe Framework.** 

It describes the Model and the View of your data. It contains what fields are stored for your data, and how they behave with each other. It contains information about how your data is named. The forms like Sales Order, Sales Invoices, Work Order are added as DocTypes in the backend.

DocType allows you to insert custom forms in ERPNext as per your requirement. 

Read [DocType documentation](https://frappe.io/docs/user/en/understanding-doctypes) for more understanding.

To create a new DocType, go to:

> Setup > Customize > Doctype > New

1. **Web View**

 You can select whether you would want a Web View of this DocType or no. Having a Web View for a DocType will allow your website users to have access to the Forms. Feel free to learn more about [Website Users](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/articles/difference-between-system-user-and-website-user).

### 1.2. More Properties

1. **Is Submittable**: You can select if you want this DocType to only be 'Saved' or to also be 'Submitted' by checking and un-checking this box.
1. **Is Child Table**: You can define if you want the New DocType to be a Child Table within another DocType. Checkout [Child Table](/docs/user/manual/en/customize-erpnext/articles/customizing-data-visibility-in-child-table) for more information.
1. **Is Single**: If checked, this Doctype will become a single form, like Sales Order, which user will
not be able to re-produce. For e.g., Selling Settings in Sales Module is a Single DocType.
1. **Is Tree**: A few DocTypes in ERPNext are structured as Trees, wherein there are some Parent DocTypes and some Children DocTypes. E.g., Doctype Company is structured as Tree, there are Parent Companies as well as Child Companies, which we call subsidiaries. If you want your DocTypes to be structured similarly, you can enable this option.

For example, check Quick Entry in [Journal Entry](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts/journal-entry#11-quick-entry).
1. **Track Changes**: You can select this option if you want to maintain a log of the changes made to each Form. Check Out [Document Versioning](/docs/user/manual/en/using-erpnext/document-versioning) for more understanding on this.
1. **Track Seen**: You can select this option if you want to maintain a log of all the Users who have seen this Form.
