# Desk Page

When you log in, you're presented with the Desk. It features a persistent sidebar sorted into categories. Each sidebar item links to a page called Desk Page.

A Desk Page represents a module (for example CRM in ERPNext). A Desk Page includes the following:

- A dashboard section for that particular module.
- A shortcut section for frequently used masters, transactions or pages.
- A masters section where all the reports and masters are grouped and listed.

## Standard Desk Page

Every module in ERPNext has its own Standard Desk Page which is generated with appropriate shortcuts and links.

Any customization to be made to the Standard Desk Page can be done with Customize Desk Page option in the top right corner of the Desk Page.

> Note: These customizations will be user-specific and will only be visible to that user.
