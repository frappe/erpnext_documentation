# Custom Field

**Every form in ERPNext has a standard set of fields. If you need to capture some information, but there is no standard Field available for it, you can insert Custom Field in a form as per your requirement.**

You can go to [Customize Form](/docs/user/manual/en/customize-erpnext/customize-form) and add the Field in a particular Form or a Document type _(hereafter referred to as DocType)_ .

To access Custom Field, go to:

> Home > Customization > Form Customization > Custom Field

You can also go to the list view of any DocType and select Customize from the Menu options.

You would be required to enter to specify your Field Type as 'Link' and enter 'Project' in the Fetch From Field to ensure that the Field is updated with the list of all the required DocTypes.
