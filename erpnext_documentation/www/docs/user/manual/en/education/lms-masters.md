## 1. Programs
To make the Program accessible on the portal, tick the 'Is Published' checkbox in the Program form. You can also tick the 'Is Featured' checkbox, which will show it on the portal landing page. The portal will automatically fetch the courses from the course table in the program.

## 2. Portal Settings
On the portal, for students to be able to view the programs on the portal, a program has to be marked as Published. On the portal students will be able to see only those courses they are enrolled to or they are allowed to enroll into.

If 'Allow Self Enroll' is not checked, the program will be visible to only those students who are already enrolled in the program, this way you can host private programs on your portal.

### 5.3 Quizzes
Instructors can also add quizzes to the topics they publish in a program. A quiz is a collection of multiple-choice questions that can be added from the Question master.

You need to set a passing score, max attempts as well as a grading basis for the quiz. The following is a description of each of these options:

1. **Passing Score**: Score out of 100 required to clear the quiz (Default: 75).
1. **Max Attempts**: Maximum number of attempts the student is allowed to take. If set to 0 it will waive off the limit and the student can attempt the quiz any number of times until the student clears the quiz.
1. **Grading Basis**: Once the max number of attempts are exhausted, the final score is taken based on the grading basis. The following are the available options:
    - Latest Highest Score: Highest Score from all attempts
    - Latest Attempt: Score from the last attempts
1. **Is Time-Bound**: If checked, the quiz will have a time limit.
1. **Duration** If the quiz is time-bound, this field can be used to set the time-limit.
