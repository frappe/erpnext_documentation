## What skills should a project champion have?

1. **Technology**: From familiarity with spreadsheets to basic troubleshooting.
2. **Domain Knowledge**: Must be familiar with the general process in procurement, sales, inventory management. And should understand the intricacies of your industry and your company.
3. **Communication**: Must possess effective oral and written communication skills and build consensus among all the stakeholders.

In many organizations, the champion is a senior manager. Occasionally, the champion is an outsider who is hired specifically to play this role.

In either case, you must identify your champion first.

Most likely it's **you!**
