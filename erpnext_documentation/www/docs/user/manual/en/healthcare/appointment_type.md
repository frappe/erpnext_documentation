# Appointment Type

You can create masters for various types of Appointments. Appointment Type allows you to predefine the duration of the appointment, specify whether it's inpatient, and set colors to differentiate between different Appointment Types for analysis.

## 1. How to Create an Appointment Type

To Create an Appointment Type, go to:

> Home > Healthcare > Consultation Setup > Appointment Type

1. Enter the "Type".
2. Check "Is Inpatient" if the Appointments created under this Type will be used for IPD.
3. Set the Default Duration (In Mins) so that when the Appointment Type is selected in Patient Appointment, the duration gets set automatically.
4. You can also set a color for each Appointment Type.

The color will help you identify the appointments of a particular type in the Calendar view.

If you want to set generic default charges and billing items, irrespective of any department, you can add a record in the Appointment Type Service Items table with no department selected.
