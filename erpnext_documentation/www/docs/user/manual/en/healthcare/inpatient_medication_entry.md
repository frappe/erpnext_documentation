# Inpatient Medication Entry

**An Inpatient Medication Entry (IPME) is created to process Inpatient Medication Orders in bulk based on some filters and to optionally update stock on dispensing the drugs.**

To access the Inpatient Medication Entry list, go to:

> Home > Healthcare > Inpatient > Inpatient Medication Entry

## 1. Prerequisites

Before creating an Inpatient Medication Entry, you need to create the following records first:

* [Patient](/docs/user/manual/en/healthcare/patient)
* [Inpatient Record](/docs/user/manual/en/healthcare/inpatient_record)
* [Inpatient Medication Order](/docs/user/manual/en/healthcare/inpatient_medication_order)

## 2. How to Create an Inpatient Medication Entry

1. Go to the Inpatient Medication Entry list and click on New.
2. Select the Company.
3. Set the Posting Date.
4. There are various filters available to fetch the pending Inpatient Medication Orders:

    - **Item Code (Drug)**
    - **Assigned To**: You can select the user who is assigned for the Inpatient Medication Order completion.
    - **Patient**
    - **Healthcare Practitioner** who has prescribed the drugs.
    - **Healthcare Service Unit** where you want to dispense the drugs. You can use these filters whenever you are dispensing drugs in a particular HSU like an Isolation Ward, etc.
    - **Date and Time filters**

If _Update Stock_ is checked, then stock validations are made and orders are processed to make Stock Entry with references updated against each entry.
You can check the references for Inpatient Medication Entry in the Stock Entry, and in Stock Entry Detail table for the Patient and corresponding Entry.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Make Stock Entry for Drug Shortage

If _Update Stock_ is checked, and the required quantity of drugs is not available for consumption in the selected warehouse, on submission, you will see a summary of all the drugs and the shortage quantity.

A **Make Stock Entry** button will be visible when the document is in the draft state and _Update Stock_ is checked. On clicking this button, the system will check for drug shortage and create a new Stock Entry for Material Transfer by mapping all the drugs and the shortage quantity for each. The "To Warehouse" for this Stock Entry will be the Medication Warehouse that you have selected in the Inpatient Medication Entry. You can then set the "Source Warehouse", save, and submit the Stock Entry to proceed with the Medication Entry.
