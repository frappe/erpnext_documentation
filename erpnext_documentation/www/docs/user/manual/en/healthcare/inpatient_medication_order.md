# Inpatient Medication Order

**An Inpatient Medication Order (IPMO) is created to make the nursing process easier. When patients are admitted to the hospital, there are medications that need to be provided to them according to the prescribed schedule. An Inpatient Medication Order is created to prescribe the medications to the admitted patient with the service unit information, the drug, dosage, dosage form, and the date and time when the drug has to be consumed.**

To access the Inpatient Medication Order list, go to:

> Home > Healthcare > Inpatient > Inpatient Medication Order

## 1. Prerequisites

Before creating an Inpatient Medication Order, you need to create the following records first:

* [Patient](/docs/user/manual/en/healthcare/patient)

### 2.3 Statuses

The statuses for IPMO are governed by the total completed order entries. The order entries are marked as completed when an [Inpatient Medication Entry](/docs/user/manual/en/healthcare/inpatient_medication_entry) is created against that order entry.

* **Draft**: A draft is saved but yet to be submitted to the system.
* **Pending**: No order entry in the Medication Orders table has been completed.
* **In Progress**: Some order entries in the Medication Orders table have been completed.
* **Completed**: All order entries in the Medication Orders table have been completed.
* **Cancelled**: The Inpatient Medication Order has been cancelled.
