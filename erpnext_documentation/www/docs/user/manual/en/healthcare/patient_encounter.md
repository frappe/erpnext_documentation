2. If you select an Appointment, Patient details, Department and Healthcare Practitioner, etc will be fetched automatically.
3. Otherwise, you can separately select a Patient. Patient details will be fetched.
4. Select the Healthcare Practitioner. The Department will be fetched automatically.
5. Set the Encounter Date and Time.
