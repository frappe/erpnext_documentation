# Complaint and Diagnosis

To ease out the data entry while recording the Patient Encounter, ERPNext Healthcare allows you to save every Complaint / Diagnosis data you enter as a Master, from the Patient Encounter screen itself. This way, the database keeps building a list of all complaints and diagnosis you entered. This is done for better analytics and reporting.

You can also configure the masters manually by going to,

> Home > Healthcare > Consultation > Complaint

> Home > Healthcare > Consultation > Diagnosis

<img class="screenshot" alt="ERPNext Healthcare" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/healthcare/diagnosis.png">

You can then select the Complaints and Diagnosis in the Patient Encounter Screen:

{next}
