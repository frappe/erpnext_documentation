### 2.1 What is a Dunning Type
Dunning Type stores default values for overdue days, dunning fee, interest rate and text blocks to be included. For example, a Dunning Type "First Notice" will not have any fees, but Dunning Type "Second Notice" will have a dunning fee and interest charged on the outstanding amount.
