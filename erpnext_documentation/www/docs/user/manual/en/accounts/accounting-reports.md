# Accounting Reports

Some of the major accounting reports are:

## 1. Company and Accounts
### General Ledger
Go to: **Accounts > Company and Accounts > General Ledger**.

The General Ledger is a detailed report for all transactions posted to each account and for every transaction there is a Credit and Debit account so it lists them all up.

The report is based on the table GL Entry and can be filtered by many pre-defined filters like Account, Cost Centers, Party, Project and Period etc. This helps you to get a full update for all entries posted in a period against any account. The result can be grouped by Account, Voucher/Transaction and Party with opening and closing balances for each group. In case of multi-currency accounting, there is also an option to check the amounts in any other currency than company's base currency.

### 2.2 Trial Balance
Go to: **Accounts > Accounting Statements > Trial Balance**.

A Trial Balance is an accounting report which lists account balances for all your Accounts
(“Ledger” and “Group”) for any given reporting period. A company prepares a trial balance periodically, usually at the end of every reporting period. The general purpose of producing a trial balance is to ensure the entries in a company's bookkeeping system are mathematically correct. The totals of Debit and Credit columns must be same for any given period, to ensure the entries are correct. In ERPNext, the report shows following columns:

  * Opening (Dr): Opening debit balance as on From Date
  * Opening (Cr): Opening credit balance as on From Date
  * Debit: Total Debited amount against the account between the selected period
  * Credit: Total Credited amount against the account between the selected period
  * Closing (Dr): Closing debit balance as on To Date
  * Closing (Cr): Closing credit balance as on To Date

There are some other options as well to include or exclude Period Closing Entries, show / hide accounts with zero balance and to show unclosed previous fiscal year's P&L (Income & Expenses) balances. All the figures in the report are shown in company's base currency.
