## 4. More
### Accounting Impact

All Sales must be booked against an “Income Account”. This refers to an
Account in the “Income” section of your Chart of Accounts. It is a good
practice to classify your income by type (like product income, service income, etc). The Income Account must be set for each row of the Items table.

> Tip: To set default Income Accounts for Items, you can set it in the Item or
Item Group.

The other account that is affected is the Account of the Customer. That is
automatically set from “Debit To” in the heading section.

You can also mention the Cost Centers in which your Income must be booked.
Remember that your Cost Centers tell you the profitability of the different
lines of business or product. You can also set a default Cost Center in the
Item master. See also: [Accounting Dimensions](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts/accounting-dimensions).

### Accounting entries (GL Entry) for a typical double entry “Sale”:
When booking a sale (accrual):

* **Debit:** Customer (grand total)
* **Credit:** Income (net total, minus taxes for each Item)
* **Credit:** Taxes (liabilities to be paid to the government)

 ![SI Ledger](/docs/assets/img/accounts/si-ledger.png)

> To see entries in your Sales Invoice after you “Submit”, click on “View
Ledger”.
