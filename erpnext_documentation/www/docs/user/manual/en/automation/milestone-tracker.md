# Milestone Tracking

> Introduced in Version 12

**You can automatically track milestones based on the lifecycle of a document if it undergoes multiple stages.**

The configuration for Milestone setting can be set in **Milestone Tracking** and each milestone is updated in **Milestone**

To access Milestone Tracker, go to:
> Home > Settings > Milestone Tracker

## 1. Creating a Milestone Tracker

1. Click on New.
1. Set the Document Type to track (example: "Issue").
1. Set the field that represents stages (example: "Status").

> Note: A milestone stage can be defined by Link or Select properties.

Once this is set, a new **Milestone** record is created every time the status of any issue is changed.

The Milestone can be viewed in the timeline of the view:

Note: Milestones work independently of Versions.

## 2. Features

Milestones can be a great source for reporting and notifying. For example, if Lead Qualification is a milestone on "Lead", milestones can help generate reports on the number of leads being qualified in a period.

### 2.1 Using Milestones with Dashboards

Used along with Dashboards, Milestones can help track the trends in milestones. For example, if "Qualification" is tracked as a "Lead Stage", a Dashboard on Milestone filtered by Qualification will show the trends of leads qualified.

### 2.2 Using Milestones with Energy Points

Energy Point Rules can be defined to automatically give Energy Points to users who achieve a milestone. This can be used to incentivize action on transactions at various levels.
