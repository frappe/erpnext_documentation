# Blanket Order

**A Blanket Order is an order from a customer to supply materials for specific items over a period of time at pre-negotiated rates.**

From a blanket order, sales orders can be generated as per the delivery schedule provided by the customer. Blanket orders help customers avoid storing materials in huge quantities while allowing them to take advantage of fixed rates by committing volumes within a specific time period.

To access Blanket Order, go to:
