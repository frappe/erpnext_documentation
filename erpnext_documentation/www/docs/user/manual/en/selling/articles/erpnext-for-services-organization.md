###Master Setup

The setup for a Service company differs primarily for Items. They don't maintain the Stock for Items and thus, don't have Warehouses.

To create a Service (non-stock) Item, in the item master, uncheck "Maintain Stock" field.

When creating Sales Order for the services, select Order Type as **Maintenance**. Sales Order of Maintenance Type needs lesser details compared to stock item's order like Delivery Note, item warehouse etc.

Service company can still add stock items to mantain their fixed assets like computers, furniture and other office equipments.

###Hiding Non-required Features

Since many modules like Manufacturing and Stock will not be required for the services company, you can hide those modules from:

`Setup > Permissions > Show/Hide Modules`

Modules unchecked here will be hidden from all the User.

####Feature Setup

Within the form, there are many fields only needed for companies into trading and manufacturing businesses. These fields can be hidden for the service company. Feature Setup is a tool where you can enable/disable specific feature. If a feature is disabled, then fields relevant to that feature is hidden from all the forms. For example, if Serial No. feature is disabled, then Serial. No. field from Item as well as from all the sales and purchase transaction will be hidden.

####Permissions

ERPNext is the permission controlled system. Users access system based on permissions assigned to them. So, if user is not assigned Role related to Stock and Manufacturing module, it will be hidden from that User.
