The feature of Discount (%) is available in all sales and purchase transactions.

If you want to apply a discount (as a Percentage) regularly for certain quantities you'd rather use a "Pricing Rule". Read [Pricing Rule](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts/pricing-rule) documentation to learn more.

## 2. Discount on Net Total or Grand Total

In the "Additional Discount" section (of a "Sales Order" or "Sales Invoice" alike), you can apply a Discount as a fixed amount or a percentage on the total sum of the Sales.
