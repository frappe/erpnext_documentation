# Shopify Integration

The Shopify Connector pulls the orders from Shopify and creates Sales Order against them in ERPNext.

While creating the sales order if Customer or Item is missing in ERPNext the system will create new Customer/Item by pulling respective details from Shopify.

### How to Setup Connector?

#### Create A  Private App in Shopify

1. Click on Apps in menu bar

#### Setting Up Shopify  on ERPNext:-
Once you have created a Private App on Shopify, setup App Credentials and other details in Shopify Settings in ERPNext.

> To access Shopify Settings, go to:
Integrations > Shopify Settings

1. Select App Type as Private and Fill-up API key, Password and Shared Secret from Shopify's Private App.

3. Setup Sync Configurations.
    The system pulls Orders from Shopify and creates Sales Order in ERPNext. You can configure ERPNext system to capture payment and fulfilments against orders.

4. Setup Tax Mapper.
    Prepare tax and shipping charges mapper for each tax and shipping charge you apply in Shopify

After setting up all the configurations, enable the Shopify sync and save the settings. This will register the API's to Shopify and the system will start Order sync between Shopify and ERPNext.


### Syncing Old Orders From Shopify

Once you are done with the Shopify configuration and have enabled Shopify Syncing, you also get a provision to sync your old orders from Shopify into ERPNext. A maximum of 250 orders will be synced every hour via a background job until all the orders within the mentioned range are synced.

Invoices can be synced based on the following two criteria

#### 1. Sync old orders based on date

1. Enable "Sync Missing Old Shopify Orders"
1. Select "Date" in the "Sync Based On" field and enter the From and To dates between which the orders need to be synced

#### 2. Sync old orders based on Shopify Order ID

1. Enable "Sync Missing Old Shopify Orders"
1. Select "Shopify Order ID" in the "Sync Based On" field and enter the From and To order IDs between which the orders need to be synced. The easiest way to get a Shopify order ID is from the URL of the order as shown in the image below

<img class="screenshot" alt="Sync Order ID" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/erpnext_integrations/shopify-order-sync-id.png">

### Note:
The connector won't handle Order cancellation. If you cancel any order in Shopify, then you will have to cancel the respective Sales Order and other documents in ERPNext manually.

#### Version 11:
We have enhanced the Shopify Integration to make it unidirectional - The Shopify Connector will pull the orders from Shopify and creates Sales Order against them in ERPNext, not the other way round.
