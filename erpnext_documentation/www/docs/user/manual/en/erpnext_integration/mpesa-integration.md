> Integrations > Payments > M-Pesa Settings

## 2.Setting up M-Pesa

To enable M-Pesa Express, you need to configure all the mandatory parameters which you have received from M-Pesa. If you want to use the staging environment of the integration, you can select the staging option and use the staging credentials provided by M-Pesa by creating a separate application for the same.

After configuring the Payment Gateway Account, you will be able to accept online payments via M-Pesa.


## 3. M-Pesa POS Payments

On setting up the POS profile with M-Pesa mode of payment, the POS checkout would show an additional information section. This section contains two fields that were automatically set-up on adding M-Pesa settings.

As soon as a POS user fills the mobile number of the customer, they can initiate a request for payment from the customer. A request is sent to the customer's M-Pesa mobile application linked with the specified mobile number. Once the payment is processed by the user, the user is prompted by a confirmation dialog to submit the payment.

## 4. M-Pesa Account Balance

Account balance linked with an individual M-Pesa can be fetched via the Get Account Balance button. This will load the M-Pesa account balance details in the dashboard.
