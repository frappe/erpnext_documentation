# Pick List

**A Pick List is a document that indicates which items should be taken from your inventory to fulfill orders.**

This is particularly useful for shippers with a large amount of inventory, volume of orders, or customers ordering many Stock Keeping Unit(SKU).
Pick list selects Warehouse where an Item is available on FIFO (First-In-First-Out) basis.
Selection of Warehouse for a batched item is different. In case of batched items, Warehouse where the batch is nearer to its expiry will be selected.

To access Pick List, go to:

> Home > Stock > Stock Transactions > Pick List
