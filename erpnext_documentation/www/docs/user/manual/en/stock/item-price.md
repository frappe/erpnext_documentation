### 1.1 Selecting the Price List

You can create multiple Price Lists for one Item in ERPNext to track Selling and Buying Price of an Item separately. Also if the Item's selling prices change based on Territory or due to other criteria, you can create multiple Selling Price Lists for it.

On selection of Price List, its currency and applicability whether for selling/buying or both will be fetched as well. To have Item Price fetching in the sales or purchase transaction, you should have 'Price List' selected in the transaction under Currency and Price List.

To check all Item Prices together, go to:

**Stock > Stock Reports > Item Price Stock**

Visit the [Price Lists](/docs/user/manual/en/stock/price-lists) page to know more.

### 2.1 Packing Unit
This is the quantity that must be bought or sold per unit of measure. For example, if Packing Unit is two, and UOM is one, two items in quantity will be transacted.
