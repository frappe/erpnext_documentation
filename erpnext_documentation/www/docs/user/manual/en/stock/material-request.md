### 1.1 Alternate ways of creating a Material Request
A Material Request can be generated automatically:

* From a [Sales Order](/docs/user/manual/en/selling/sales-order).
* When the Projected Quantity of an Item in Stores (Warehouses) reaches a particular level.
* From your a [Production Plan](/docs/user/manual/en/manufacturing/production-plan) to plan your manufacturing activities.

If your Items are inventory items, you must also mention the Warehouse where you expect these Items to be delivered. This helps to keep track of the [Projected Quantity](/docs/user/manual/en/stock/projected-quantity) for this Item.

> Info: Material Request is not mandatory. It is ideal if you have centralized
buying so that you can collect this information from various departments.

These are the statuses a Material Request can be in:

* **Draft**: A draft is saved but yet to be submitted to the system.

* **Canceled**: The materials are not needed at all and the request is canceled.
* **Pending**: The Purchase/Manufacture is pending to complete the Material Request.
