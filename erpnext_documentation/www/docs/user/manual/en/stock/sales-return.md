# Sales Return

**A sold Item being returned is known as a Sales Return.**

Businesses often return goods that are already sold. They could be returned by the customer due to quality issues, non-delivery on the agreed date, or any other reason.

## 1. Prerequisites
Before creating and using a Sales Return, it is advised that you create the following first:

* [Item](/docs/user/manual/en/stock/item)
* [Sales Invoice](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts/sales-invoice)

    Or

    [Delivery Note](/docs/user/manual/en/stock/delivery-note)

## 2. How to create a Sales Return

1. First open the original Delivery Note / Sales Invoice, against which Customer returned the Items.

If Perpetual Inventory is enabled, the system will also post accounting entry against warehouse account to sync warehouse account balance with stock balance as per Stock Ledger.

## 3. Impact on Stock Return via Delivery Note
On Creating a Sales Return against a Delivery Note:

* The **Returned Quantity** in the original Delivery Note along with any Sales Order linked to it, is updated.
