# Employee Onboarding 

**In the process of hiring an Employee, there are set of standard activities which need to be executed. This feature helps you to maintain the masters of these activities, and create a set of tasks at the time of each Employee hiring.**

Employee Onboarding is created for a Job Application, who is approved for the hiring.

**Use Case:** Let's assume that following are the activities which need to be performed as soon as a job applicant is approved to be hired.

- Perform a legal and professional background check
- Create an Employee master
- Create an Email Account
- Create an identity card
- Allocate leaves


In ERPNext, these standard activities can be tracked in the Employee Onboarding Template. To access Employee Onboarding, go to: 

> Human Resources > Employee Lifecycle > Employee Onboarding
