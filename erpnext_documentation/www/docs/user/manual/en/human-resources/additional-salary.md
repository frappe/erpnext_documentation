# Additional Salary

**Additional Salary is something that an Employee receives from the company they work for, other than their usual pay.**


ERPNext offers you a feature called Additional Salary to add or deduct ad hoc salary for a particular Employee while processing the Payroll. Some examples of Additional Salary could be Performance Bonus, Deputation Allowance, Arrears, Incentives, or other adjustments.

To access Additional Salary, go to:

## 2. How to create an Additional Salary
