### Approving Expenses

Approver for the Expense Claim is selected by an Employee himself. Employee can choose from the list of users who are configured as _Expense Approvers_ for their [Department](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/department).

When a new Expense Claim is created, if the selected expense approver does not have access to it, the document is shared with the approver with "submit" permission.

After saving Expense Claim, Employee should [Assign document to Approver](/docs/user/manual/en/using-erpnext/assignment). On assignment, approving user will also receive email notification. To automate email notification, you can also setup Email Alert

Expense Claim Approver can update the “Sanctioned Amounts” against Claimed Amount of an Employee. If submitting, Approval Status should be submitted to Approved or Rejected. If Approved, then Expense Claim gets submitted. If rejected, then Expense Approver's comments can be added in the Comments section explaining why the claim was approved or rejected.
