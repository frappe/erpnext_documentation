### 3.1 Payment Entry for Donation

On submitting a donation, you can create a Payment Entry against it using the **Create Payment Entry** button.

### 3.2 RazorPay for Donations

You can set up RazorPay for capturing donations. You can find instructions on setting up razorpay [here](/docs/user/manual/en/erpnext_integration/razorpay-integration).

You can follow the steps listed below to setup Razorpay for donations.

1. Setup RazorPay
1. Setup RazorPay Webhook

#### 3.2.1 Setup RazorPay

You can find instructions on setting up razorpay [here](/docs/user/manual/en/erpnext_integration/razorpay-integration).

In order to capture the donations, you need to set certain defaults in the Donation Settings section in the [Non Profit Settings](/docs/user/manual/en/non_profit/non_profit_settings)

1. **Default Company**: This company will be set for the Donations created via webhook.
1. **Default Donor Type**: This Donor Type will be set for the Donor created via Donation webhook.
1. **Automate Donation Payment Entries**: You can enable this to auto-create Payment Entry for Donation entry created via webhook.

If _Automate Donation Payment Entries_ is enabled, you will have to set the default Debit Account and Donation Payment Account for Payment Entry.

#### 3.2.2 Setting up webhook

You can set up a webhook from the RazorPay dashboard in Settings. You can read more about webhooks in RazorPay [here](https://razorpay.com/docs/webhooks/). This webhook will notify your ERPNext site whenever a new donation is created.

<img class="screenshot" alt="Donation Webhook" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/non_profit/donation-webhook.png">

You will need the following details to set up the webhook.

1. **Webhook URL**: The following is the URL for your ERPNext site. This is the endpoint RazorPay will utilize to notify of any new donations created.

    ```sh
    https://<your-site>/api/method/erpnext.non_profit.doctype.donation.donation.capture_razorpay_donations
    ```

2. **Secret**: In order to secure your API endpoint, it is always better to generate and set a Webhook Secret for the API Endpoint. To do so, on your ERPNext site, you can click on the **Donations > Generate Webhook Secret** button in the Non Profit Settings. Copy the secret and paste it in the secret field on the RazorPay dashboard to set up webhooks.

3. **Event**: You have to enable the `payment.captured` event.

4. **Active**: Check this to enable the webhook.

With this, your webhook is activated.
