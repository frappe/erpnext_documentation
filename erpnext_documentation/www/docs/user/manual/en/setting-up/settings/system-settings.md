## 1. Sections in System Settings

### 1.1 General

* **Country**: You can set the default country here, this will be fetched when creating new addresses. If your company has multiple branches in different countries, choose the head office location.
* **Time Zone**: Sets time automatically based on the time zone.
* **Language**: Sets the global language for the ERPNext account. Then language will be changed in all the menus, transactions, masters, etc.

### 1.2 Date and Number Format

* **Date Format**: Format in which dates will be displayed. For e.g., dd.mm.yyyy or mm/dd/yyyy. This depends on how dates are formatted in your region.
* **Time Format**: Format in which time will be displayed. You can choose to show (`HH:mm:ss`) or hide seconds by setting the option as (`HH:mm`) .
* **Number Format**: Format in which numbers will be formatted. For e.g., 1,000 or 1000.00.
* **Float Precision**: The number of zeros displayed after the decimal point for quantities etc. The range is 2-9. Default is 3.
* **Currency Precision**: Number of zeros displayed after the decimal point for currency values. If left blank, it will be based on the **Number Format**.

### 1.3 Backups

In ERPNext you can backup the database as well as your files. Database backups are created automatically while file backups need to be downloaded explicitly.

This field shows the number of backups after which older ones will be deleted. By default, 3 backups are saved over 24 hours. New backups are automatically created every few hours and the newest backup will overwrite the oldest one. For a backup of files, click on the Download Files Backup button in the Download Backups form.

Keeping regular backups of your system is a good practice in case of any mishap and you want to roll back or just for your records.

### 1.4 Permissions

Using permissions, you can limit user access to document types. The limitation can be based on fields like Company, Territory, Branch, etc. To know more about User Permissions, [click here](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/users-and-permissions/user-permissions).


If Apply Strict User Permissions checkbox is ticked and User Permission is defined for a DocType for a User, then all the documents where the value of the link is **blank**, will not be shown to that User.

This is done from:
> Home > Users and Permissions > Permissions > User Permissions

For example: If you set User Permissions for Territory and set the value as India. If the checkbox is unticked, all transactions (sales orders, quotations) with India and **blank** will be shown to the users.

If the Apply Strict User Permissions checkbox is ticked, documents, where Territory is blank, will not be shown to the users.

### 1.5 Security

* **Session Expiry**: Number of idle hours after which you'll be logged out of a session. This helps in better security. For example, if there is no activity for 6 hours, your account will be logged out.
* **Session Expiry Mobile**: Session expiry when logged in from a mobile phone.
* **Allow only one session per user**: If you want to use a single set of credentials for multiple users, tick this checkbox. The number of simultaneous sessions can be changed under User master. Mobile phone sessions are not counted here.
* **Allow Login using Mobile Number**: By checking the 'Allow Login using Mobile Number' checkbox, you can log in to ERPNext using a valid mobile number set in your User account.

* **Show Full Error and Allow Reporting of Issues to the Developer**: This will display the whole error on the screen and allow reporting issues. If you have technical knowledge in this area, you can get a better idea of the error by reading the whole message.
