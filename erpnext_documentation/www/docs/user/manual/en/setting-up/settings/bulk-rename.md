# Bulk Renaming of Records

**Bulk Renaming allows renaming multiple records at once.**

You can rename a document in ERPNext (if it is allowed) by going to **Menu > Rename** in the document.

Alternatively, if you want to rename a whole bunch of records, use the Rename Tool. Go to:

![Renaming a document](/docs/assets/img/setup/renaming-a-document.gif)

> Home > Settings > Rename Tool

This tool will allow you to rename multiple records at the same time.

To rename multiple records, upload a **.csv** file with the old names in the first column and the new names in the second column. Then click on **Upload**.

You can also merge documents by renaming them. For example, if you have a customer named Steve and a duplicate named Steve1, you can go to either of them, click on Menu > Rename and tick the 'Merge with existing' checkbox. This will merge all the linked documents of both documents. To know more, [visit this page](/docs/user/manual/en/using-erpnext/articles/merging-documents).
