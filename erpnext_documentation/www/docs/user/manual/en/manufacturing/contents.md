# Manufacturing

The Manufacturing module in ERPNext covers all necessary features a Manufacturing business would need. There are options to take a Work Order, enter stock of items, create a Production Plan, create a Downtime Entry, manage the Bill of Materials for Finished Goods / Template Items, generate reports, and more.

Different types of manufacturing like make to stock, make to order, and engineer to order can be managed in the ERPNext Manufacturing module.
