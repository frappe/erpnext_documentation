# Purchase Order

**A Purchase Order is a binding contract with your Supplier that you promise to buy a set of items under given conditions.**

It is similar to a Sales Order but instead of sending it to an external party, you keep it for internal records.

* **Quantity and Rate**: When you select the Item code, it's name, description, and UOM will be fetched. The 'UOM Conversion Factor' is set to 1 by default, you can change it depending on the UOM received from the seller, more in the next section.

    'Price List Rate' will be fetched if a Standard Buying rate is set. 'Last Purchase Rate' shows the rate of the item from your last Purchase Order. Rate is fetched if set in the item master. You can attach an Item Tax Template to apply a specific tax rate to the item.

* **Accounting Details**: This section is autofilled for a Purchase Order. 'Expense Account' is the account against which the PO is billed and Cost Center is the CC against which the PO is charged.

A “Required By” date on each Item: If you are expecting part delivery, your Supplier will know how much quantity to deliver at which date. This will help you from preventing over-supply. It will also help you to track how well your Supplier is doing on timeliness.

**Allow Zero Valuation Rate**: Ticking on 'Allow Zero Valuation Rate' will allow submitting the Purchase Receipt even if the Valuation Rate of the Item is 0. This can be a sample item or due to a mutual understanding with your Supplier.

### 3.6 Raw Materials Supplied
This section appears when 'Supply Raw Materials' supplied is set to 'Yes'. This section shows a table with the Items to be supplied to the Supplier for the subcontracting process.

### 3.7 Purchase UOM and Stock UOM Conversion

You can change your UOM as per your stock requirements in the Purchase Order.

For example, If you have bought your raw material in large quantities with UOM - boxes, and wish to stock them in UOM - Nos; you can do so while making your Purchase Order.

1. Store UOM as Nos in the Item master. Note that the UOM in the Item master is the stock UOM.

2. In the Purchase Order mention UOM as Box. (Since material arrives in Boxes)

3. In the Warehouse and Reference section, the UOM will be pulled in as Nos (from the Item form):

 <img class="screenshot" alt="Purchase Order - UOM" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/buying/purchase-order-uom.png">

4. Mention the UOM conversion factor. For example, (1); If one box has 1 kilo.

5. Notice that the stock quantity will be updated accordingly.

### 3.8 Taxes and Charges

If your Supplier is going to charge you additional taxes or charge like a
shipping or insurance charge, you can add it here. It will help you to
accurately track your costs. Also, if some of these charges add to the value
of the product you will have to mention them in the Taxes table.

Visit the [Purchase Taxes and Charges Template](/docs/user/manual/en/buying/purchase-taxes-and-charges-template) page to know more about taxes.

The total taxes and charges will be displayed below the table.

To add taxes automatically via a Tax Category, visit [this page](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts/tax-category).

Make sure to mark all your taxes in the Taxes and Charges table correctly for an accurate valuation.

#### Shipping Rule
A Shipping Rule helps set the cost of shipping an Item. The cost will usually increase with the distance of shipping. To know more, visit the [Shipping Rule](/docs/user/manual/en/selling/shipping-rule) page.

<img class="screenshot" alt="Purchase Order Taxes" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/buying/po-taxes.png">

For example, you buy Items worth X and sell them for 1.3X. So your Customer
pays 1.3 times the tax you pay your Supplier. Since you have already paid tax
to your Supplier for X, what you owe your government is only the tax on 0.3X.

This is very easy to track in ERPNext since each tax head is also an Account.
Ideally you must create two Accounts for each type of VAT you pay and collect,
“Purchase VAT-X” (asset) and “Sales VAT-X” (liability), or something to that
effect.

### 3.9 Additional Discount
Other than recording discount per item, you can add a discount to the whole purchase order in this section. This discount could be based on the Grand Total i.e., post tax/charges or Net total i.e., pre tax/charges. The additional discount can be applied as a percentage or an amount.

Read [Applying Discount](/docs/user/manual/en/selling/articles/applying-discount) for more details.

### 3.10 Payment Terms
Sometimes payment is not done all at once. Depending on the agreement, half of the payment may be made before shipment and the other half after receiving the goods/services. You can add a Payment Terms template or add the terms manually in this section.

Read [Payment Terms](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts/payment-terms) to know more.

### 3.11 Terms and Conditions
In Sales/Purchase transactions there might be certain Terms and Conditions based on which the Supplier provides goods or services to the Customer. You can apply the Terms and Conditions to transactions to transactions and they will appear when printing the document.
