# Website Settings

Website related settings like landing page and website wide theme can be
configured here.

To access Website Settings, go to:
> Home > Website > Setup > Website Settings

## 1. Landing Page

Configure the default landing page of your website by setting the **Home Page**
field to the route of that page. You can put any route here including standard
routes like `home`, `about`, `contact`, `login`, `all-products`, and `blog`.

You can also set a [Web Page](/docs/user/manual/en/website/web-page) as the
landing page.

If you want to use the ERPNext [Homepage](/docs/user/manual/en/website/homepage),
you must set it as `home`.

## 7. Google Integrations

### 7.1 Google Indexing

#### How to set up automated Google Indexing

In order to allow ERPNext to request Google crawlers to index a web page, you need to authorize ERPNext to send a request whenever the user requests the data. Google Drive Integration is set up with the following steps:

- Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials via [Google Settings](/docs/user/manual/en/erpnext_integration/google_settings)

- Enable indexing in the Website Settings

- Now click on **Authorize API Indexing Access** to authorize ERPNext to send a publish request.

- Once Authorized, an indexing request is automatically sent on creation/update/trash of any new blog post or web pages created via the user.

### 7.2 Google Analytics

You can enable Google Analytics on your website. Just get your [Google Analytics
ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en) from your Google
Console and set it here.

By default, Google Analytics will collect the full IP address of your website visitors.
By checking "Google Analytics Anonymize IP", ERPNext will instruct Google Analytics to
anonymize the IP address before it is sent to Google servers. You can find out more about
the effect of this setting in [Google's documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052).

## 8. HTML Header

You can use this section to set meta tags across all of your web pages. A common
use case is to add Google site verification tags.

You can define `robots.txt` rules in this section. This information is used by
web crawlers to decide which pages to index and which to skip.

## 10. Redirects

You can define a mapping of route redirects here. The mappings in the following
screenshot makes sure that if a user visits `https://apple.erpnext.com/iphone`,
they will be redirected to `https://apple.erpnext.com/products/iphone`.

ERPNext will raise a `301 Permanent Redirect` response for these routes.
