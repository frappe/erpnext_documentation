# Blog Post

**A Blog Post is an article on your website.**

Blogs are a great way to share your thoughts about your business.
It helps keep your customers and readers updated on news related to your business.

In the age of the internet, writing assumes a lot of significance because when
people come to your website, they want to read about you and your product.

To access the Blog Post, go to:
> Home > Website > Blog > Blog Post

### 2.3 Meta Tags

Meta tags are HTML tags which describe a page and its content to a search engine or a social media platform. A meta description provides a brief description of a webpage. 

In HTML, the meta description tag will be written as follows:

```<head>
    <meta name="description" content="This is an example of a meta description. This will often show up in search results.">
    </head>
```

Under the SEO section, you can add the meta description and image for your blog post. ERPNext will generate a preview of the blog when listed as a search result by Google.

If you leave this section empty, the blog introduction or the first 140 characters of the blog will be shown as the meta description. In the same way, if you leave the meta image empty, the first image in the blog will be selected.

On submitting the blog, you can also preview how the blog will look when shared on a social media platform like Facebook or Twitter. To check this, use the debugging tools offered by the platforms:

- Facebook: [Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)

- Twitter: [Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)

- LinkedIn: [Post Inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/inspect/)

To check the post preview, simply enter the webpage/blog link in the tool:
