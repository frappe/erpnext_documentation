The BOM is a list of all materials (either bought or made) and operations that go into a finished product or sub-Item.

This video walks you through creating masters (like Item, Operations, Workstation etc.) required for setting up BOM. Once you have all these masters in place, using them you can create Bill of Materials for the sub-assembly, finished and sub-contracted items.
