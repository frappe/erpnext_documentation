This video is a recording of a webinar on how retailers can use ERPNext. For the ease of invoicing for retailers, we have a dedicated POS view. It takes care of invoicing, delivery and payment in one entry. Given the limitation of time availability and frequency of transaction, you can also create POS Invoices in the offline mode.
