####Scenario

An order is received for ten Wind Turbines. Sales Order is also created for ten units. Due to scarcity of stock, only seven units are delivered to the customer. Pending three units are to be delivered soon. Customer informs that they don't need to deliver pending item, as they have purchased it from other vendor.

In this case, create Delivery Note and Sales Invoice will be created only for the seven units. And the Sales Order should be set as stopped.
