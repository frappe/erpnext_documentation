# Selling

Selling is the communication that happens with the customer prior to and
during the sale. You might be managing all the communication yourself or you
may have a small team of sales people to handle this. ERPNext helps you track
the communication leading up to the sale by keeping all your documents in an
organized and searchable manner.
