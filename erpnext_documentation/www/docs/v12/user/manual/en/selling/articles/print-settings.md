# Print Settings


You can print your quotation/sales order on your company's letterhead. Know more [here](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/print/letter-head).

'Group same items' will group the same items added multiple times in the items table. This can be seen when your print.

Quotations can also be titled as “Proforma Invoice” or “Proposal”.
You can do this by selecting a **Print Heading**. To create new Print Headings go to **Setup > Printing > Print Heading**. Know more [here](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/print/print-headings).
