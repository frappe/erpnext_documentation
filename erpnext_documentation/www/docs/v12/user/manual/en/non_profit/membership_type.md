#Membership Type

Membership Types are a basic building block for membership management. Typically an organization will set up a membership type for each of the different memberships that they offer. For the simplest membership structures, one membership type may be enough. For more complex membership structures, more membership types may be required. For example, an organization may define three membership types for 'regular', 'student', and 'honorary' members. Or an organization may choose to use membership types as subscriptions to their different publications, either free or paying ones.

In this chapter we will cover the most common set-up for membership types.

To create new Membership Type go to:

> Non Profit > Membership Type > New

**Membership Type:** The Membership Type is displayed throughout the system, on both public and backend pages so spend some time thinking about a membership type name that is appropriate to both audiences. It can be changed at a later date

**Amount:** If your memberships are free you should enter 0 (zero) in this field. Otherwise you should enter the amount that must be paid for this membership type.

**Linked Item**: If you have checked _Enable Invoicing_ in Membership Settings, you will get an option to configure a billable service item for your Membership Type.
