# Setting Up Taxes

**Taxes are compulsory contributions to the state/country revenue.**

One of the primary motivators for compulsory use of accounting tools is the
calculation of taxes. ERPNext allows you to make configurable tax templates that you can apply to your sales or
purchase transactions.

## 1. Tax Accounts

For Tax Accounts that you want to use in the tax templates, go to:
> Home > Accounting > Chart of Accounts

Select an account and click on edit. Select the 'Account Type' as 'Tax' for the account.

## 2. Sales Taxes and Charges Template
Sales Taxes and Charges Template fetched taxes for your sales transactions like [Sales Order](/docs/user/manual/en/selling/sales-order) and [Sales Invoice](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts/sales-invoice).
