# Credit Limit

**Credit Limit is the maximum amount of credit you are willing to offer to a Customer.**

A Credit Limit is the maximum amount of credit that a financial institution or
other lender will extend to a debtor for a particular line of credit. From a
Customer's perspective, it is the maximum amount of goods or services they can get without paying money upfront.

You can set the Credit Limit in Customer, Customer Group, and in the Company.
When a Sales Order or a Sales Invoice is submitted, the Credit Limit will be checked.

The order of precedence for checking Credit Limit is as follows:

* Credit Limit set in Customer
* Credit Limit set in Customer Group
* Credit Limit set in Company
