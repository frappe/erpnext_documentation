# Bank Account

In ERPNext, Bank Accounts can be created for a Company as well as other parties like Customers, Suppliers etc. Doing this lets you record all the bank transactions correctly for accounting accuracy.

You can add Bank Accounts in ERPNext for Company. Supplier, Customer, or any other party with whom transactions are carried out. Then the Bank Account can be chosen in [Payment Entries](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts/payment-entry) as a [Mode of Payment](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts/mode-of-payment).

To access Bank Account, go to:
> Home > Accounting > Bank Statement > Bank Account
