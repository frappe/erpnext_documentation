The _Total Exemption Amount_ will be exempted from annual taxable earnings of the employee while calculating the tax deductions in the last payroll.

> Note: Even if employees submit exemption proofs anytime during the payroll period, ERPNext will only consider this in the last payroll of the Payroll Period for adjusting the final taxes based on the proof submitted. If you need to adjust any additional tax collected or consider proof submission of employees anytime before the last payroll, while processing Payroll Entry (or in the Salary Slip of the employee) check the _Deduct Tax For Unsubmitted Tax Exemption Proof_ option.

### Regional - India
For the current fiscal year, in India, House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemption from taxable earnings is the minimum of:

* The actual amount allotted by the employer as the HRA.
* Actual rent paid less 10% of the basic salary.
* 50% of the basic salary, if the employee is staying in a metro city (40% for a non-metro city).

As part of the Employee Tax Exemption Proof Submission, employees shall also submit proof for HRA Exemption. ERPNext will calculate the exemption eligible for HRA and exempt it while calculating the taxable earnings in the last payroll of the Payroll Period.

> Note: HRA component shall be configured in Company for HRA exemption to work
