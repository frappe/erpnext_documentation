> **Note:** Enable the 'Add unused leaves from previous allocations' option in case you want to carry forward unused leaves from the previous allocation period for this particular Leave Type.

### 2.1 Allocating Leaves through Leave Period

 Leaves are usually allocated for a particular [Leave Period](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/leave-period). Once a Leave Period is created and saved, you can click on the **Grant** button to generate Leave Allocations based on the [Leave Policy](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/leave-policy) applicable to each Employee.

 You can allocate leaves based on [Employee Grade](/docs/v12/user/manual/en/human-resources/employee-grade), [Department](/docs/v12/user/manual/en/human-resources/department) or [Designation](/docs/v12/user/manual/en/human-resources/designation).

Once granted, the leaves will be automatically allocated to the selected Employees based on the Leave Policy set in their [Employee](/docs/v12/user/manual/en/human-resources/employee) master. You can check the newly allocated leaves in the Leave Allocation list.
