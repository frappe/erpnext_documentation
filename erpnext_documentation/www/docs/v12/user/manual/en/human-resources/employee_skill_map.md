# Employee Skill Map

Employee Skill Map is a record which helps your organization track your Employee's skill sets and trainings. It can be used to rate each skill of the Employee and track their growth after each internal training. This data can be used at the time of appraisals.

To record an Employee Skill Map go to:

> Home > Human Resource > Employee Lifecycle > Employee Skill Map

Make sure you have set the required Skills for designations from the Skill doctype.
