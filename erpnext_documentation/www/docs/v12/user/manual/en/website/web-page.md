### 1.1 Tips on making a good Web Page

####  Title

The first thing to set is the title of your page. The title has the maximum
weight for search engines so choose a title that reflects the keywords that you
are targeting for your audience. The route (URL) will be auto-generated from the
title but you can change it.

#### Content

You can write your content in Rich Text, Markdown or HTML. If you want to make
simple content pages, Rich Text and Markdown are great options.

> Learn markdown in a few minutes at [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

#### Images

For Rich Text Content, you can directly embed images using the editor. For
Markdown and HTML, you must attach the images to the document first. Now get the
URL of your image by right-clicking on your attachment and copying the address.

Now, add them to your Markdown or HTML using the appropriate syntax.

```md
<!-- markdown -->
![Alt Text](/path/to/image-url.png)

<!-- html -->
<img src="/path/to/image-url.png" alt="Alt Text">
```
