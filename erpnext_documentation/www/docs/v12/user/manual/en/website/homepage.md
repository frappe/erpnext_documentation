> this to work.

## 2. Hero Section

There are three ways in which you can customize the way the Hero Section looks:

1. Tag Line and Description (Default).

1. Custom Hero Section.

### 2.1 Tag Line and Description

After you set your Tag Line, Description and Hero Image you'll have a decent
looking front page. You can also change the URL for the Explore button under **URL for "All Products"**.

You can add custom sections on your Homepage by creating new Homepage Sections.

A homepage section can consist of cards or Custom HTML. Set **Section Based On**
to **Cards**.

Add details for each card like Title, Subtitle, Image, Content and Route in the
Section Cards table.

You can also control the order in which these sections appear by setting the
**Section Order**. 0 will be shown first, followed by 1, and so on.

ERPNext allows you to have a completely different homepage if you don't want to
use the default one described above.

1. Create a [Web Page](/docs/user/manual/en/website/web-page).
1. Go to Website > Setup > Website Settings.
1. Set Home Page as the `route` of your Web Page.
