# Google Contacts Integration

ERPNext provides an integration with Google Contacts in order for all users to synchronize their Google Contacts with ERPNext.

- Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials via [Google Settings](/docs/user/manual/en/erpnext_integration/google_settings).
- In the Google Contacts list, click on New. Enter the Google Account Email you want to sync and then save it. Now click on **Authorize Contacts Access** to authorize ERPNext to get Contacts data from Google.
