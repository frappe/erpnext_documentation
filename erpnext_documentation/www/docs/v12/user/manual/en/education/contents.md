# Education Domain

Whether you are running a B-School, an Academy or even a Primary School, the ERPNext Education Module helps you in organizing your entire set-up. You can have your entire Student Database, Fee Structure, Staffing Information, Courses, Curriculum, all defined in ERPNext.

We also understand that an Educational Institute needs a lot more than a simple 'Education Module', and ERPNext has all of it available built-in. You can:

- Track your books of accounts using [Accounts module](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts).
- Manage payroll, leaves, and claims of your admin and teaching staff in the [HR module](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources).
- Organize your [purchases](/docs/user/manual/en/buying) and place an approval system.

Here are the functionalities available under the ERPNext Education domain to go through after this **[introduction](/docs/user/manual/en/education/introduction)**
