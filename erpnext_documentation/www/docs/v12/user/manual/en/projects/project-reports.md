## 3. Employee Hours Utilization Based on Timesheets

**This report gives you an overview of the utilization of employee working hours based on Timesheets submitted.**

The Employee Working hours are divided into 3 categories:
    
1. Billed Hours
2. Non-Billed Hours
3. Un-tracked Hours (Total - Billed - Non-Billed)

Two types of percentage utilizations are calculated for each employee:

```
% Utilization (Billed + Non-Billed) = [(Billed Hours + Non-Billed Hours) / (Total Hours)] * 100

% Utilization (Billed Only) = (Billed Hours / Total Hours) * 100
```

where **Total Hours** is the number of working hours in the selected *date range*.

The report can also be filtered for a particular Employee, Department and/or Project.
