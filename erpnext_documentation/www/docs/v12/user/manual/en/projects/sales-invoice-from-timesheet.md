# Sales Invoice from Timesheet

A customer can be billed based on the total number of hours an employee has worked for that customer. The actual number of hours of billable work can be tracked via a [Timesheet](/docs/user/manual/en/projects/timesheets/). 

**A sales invoice can be generated from each Timesheet submitted by an employee which can be used to bill the customer.**
