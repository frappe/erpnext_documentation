# Introduction to the Project Module

A services company needs a lot more features than a project module to operate at its full potential. ERPNext has all these features built-in.

- You track your books of accounts using the [Accounts module](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts.html).
- Manage payroll, leaves and claims of your support staff in the [HR module](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources.html).
- Attend customer's support queries better with the [Support](/docs/user/manual/en/support.html) module of ERPNext.

ERPNext helps you manage your Projects by breaking them into Tasks and
allocating them to different people.

Projects can be used to manage internal projects, manufacturing jobs or
service jobs. For service jobs, Time Sheets can also be created that can be used to bill Customers if billing is done on a Time & Money basis.

## Sales, Purchase Management, and Customer Support

Purchasing and selling can also be tracked against Projects and this can help the company keep tabs on its budget, delivery and profitability for a Project.
