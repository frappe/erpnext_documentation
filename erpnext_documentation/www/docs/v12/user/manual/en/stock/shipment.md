### 3.1. Shipment Parcel

You can specify the length, width, height and, weight of a parcel in the Shipment. If there are multiple parcels with identical dimensions, the **count** field can be set accordingly.

To automatically fetch frequently used parcel dimensions, a Parcel Template can be created and set in the **Parcel Template** field. After adding the template, click on the **Add template** button.
