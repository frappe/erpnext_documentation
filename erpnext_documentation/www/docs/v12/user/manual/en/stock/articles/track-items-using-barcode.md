# Track Items Using Barcode

A barcode is a value decoded into vertical spaced lines. Barcode scanners are the input medium, like Keyboard. When it scans a barcode, the data appears in the computer screens at the point of a cursor.

## Item Master

To set the barcode of a particular item, you will have to open the Item record. You can also enter barcode while creating a new item.
