# Packing Slip

**A packing slip is a document that lists the items in a shipment.**

It is usually attached to the goods delivered.

From a single Delivery Note, multiple Packing Slips can be created. It is useful when the shipment is packed in different boxes. Each box can have a weight and number of Items it contains. For example, if you're shipping 20 chairs in 4 boxes, each box can contain 5 chairs with different Packing Slips for each box.

To access the Packing Slip list, go to:
> Home > Stock > Tools > Packing Slip
<p></p>
> Note: In order to create Packing Slips from a Delivery Note, the Delivery Note needs to be in the Draft stage.

### 1.1 Additional options when creating a Packing Slip
**To Package No**: If there are multiple packages of the same type to be shipped at once then set the From and To Package numbers. For example, package numbers 1 to 5 in one Packing Slip, then package numbers 6 to 10 in the next Packing Slip and so on. This will be shown if you print then Packing Slip.
