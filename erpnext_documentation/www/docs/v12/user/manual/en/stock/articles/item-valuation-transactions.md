# Item Valuation Methods and Transactions

In ERPNext, Item's stock valuation is updated on the creation of one of the following transaction.

1.  Purchase Receipt
2.  Stock Entry of type Material Receipt
3.  Stock Reconciliation made for updating stock opening balance

You can select valuation method based on which item's value will be calculated. Valuation Method can be set globally for all the items from the Stock Settings.

You can also set Valuation Method in the item master, especially when a valuation method for an item is different from the default Method.
