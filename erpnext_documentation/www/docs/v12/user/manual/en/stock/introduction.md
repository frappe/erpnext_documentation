# Introduction

Businesses have a large part of their financial resources invested in the stock items they trade. With ERPNext, you can always keep a bird's eye view on your stock availability, replenishment, procurement, sales, and much more.

## 1. Core Stock Transactions
There are three **main** types of entries:

* **Purchase Receipt**: Items received from Suppliers against Purchase Orders.
* **Stock Entry**: Items transferred from one Warehouse to another.
* **Delivery Note**: Items shipped to Customers.

Apart from these core transactions, there are other documents available in ERPNext Stock module to manage Stock Reconciliation, Item Prices, deliveries, serial numbers, batch numbers, quality inspections, returns, etc.

Here's a view of Item Stock Summary in ERPNext.
