# Automate Lead Creation
Leads come from many different sources. It is important that all leads are recorded, assigned to sales executives and followed up.

## 1. Create Leads From Emails

You may have an email address like 'sales@yourcompany.com' which is probably displayed on your website. People may send emails asking information about your products and services. You can enable [Email Account](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/email/email-account)  to pull these emails and create a lead for each email.

## 2. Create Leads From Webforms

You can also map the Lead form to a [Web Form](/docs/user/manual/en/website/web-form) and publish it on your website. When visitors of your website fill the form, it will be automatically added as a Lead.

## 3. Create Leads From Incomplete Orders in E-Commerce Module

You can publish an e-commerce website and allow users to place an order for your products. If a user selects items but doesn't complete the process you can pursue that user as a lead.

## 4. Create Leads By Importing Spreadsheet

If you have a spreadsheet with details of the leads, you can use the [Data Import](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/data/data-import) feature to import the leads.
