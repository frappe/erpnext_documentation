# Customer Group

**Customer Group is an aggregation of customers that are similar in some way.**

Customer groups allow you to organize your customers. Typically Customers are grouped by market segment based on the domain in which a business operates. Customer Groups are created in hierarchical manner in ERPNext. You can create a main customer group and add sub customer groups under it.

You can define a price a list which will be automatically applied to all customers belonging to that group. You can also get trend analysis for each group. Individual, Commercial and Government customer groups are created by default. You can add your own customer groups based on your requirement like retail, wholesale etc.

### 1. How to Create a Customer Group
1. Go to **CRM > Settings > Customer Group**.
1. Click on a parent customer group like 'All Customer Groups'.
1. Click on 'Add Child'.

> Tip: If you think all this is too much effort, you can leave it at “Default
Customer Group”. But all this effort, will pay off when you start getting
reports. An example of a sample report is given below:
