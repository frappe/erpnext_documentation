## 4. Using Dashboards

Every chart will be shown according to the fields set in the corresponding Dashboard Chart. The result from the dashboard chart source is cached to avoid redundant queries. Since the chart data can be stale, each chart will also show the last synced time.

The filters used to generate the chart data can also be changed by clicking `Set Filters`. The chart will be refreshed automatically according to the recently set filters.

To get the most recent data each chart has to be refreshed forcefully by clicking **Force Refresh** button from the dropdown menu.
