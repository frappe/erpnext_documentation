# Assignment

**Assign To is a feature in ERPNext that allows you to assign a particular document to a specific user, who needs to further work on that document.**

For example, if a Sales Order needs to be approved or submitted by the Sales Manager, the first draft user can assign that Sales Order to the Sales Manager. 

On assigning this document to the Sales Manager, it will be added to that user's ToDo list. 

Similarly, for a Delivery Note and a Sales Invoice against this sales Order, the assignment can be done to a Material User and an Account User.

> Note: Assignment can be done irrespective of Permission Restrictions.
