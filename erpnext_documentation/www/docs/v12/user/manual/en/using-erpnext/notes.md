### Visibility of Notes

You can select whether or not you want this particular Note to be Public. Making a Note public will allow you to share it across Users in your ERPNext account.

Once you enable making a Note Public, there will be another checkbox, saying 'Notify users with a popup when they log in'.

You can also select if you wish to give some specific users, the right to read, write or share your note. This can be done from the 'Share' option in the left sidebar.
