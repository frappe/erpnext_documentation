# Collaborating Around Forms

**In ERPNExt, every form comes with certain tools embedded in the system which allows you to collaborate with other users within your account to have quick and transparent operations.** 

Following are the tools in each document using which you can collaborate with other Users in your ERPNext account.

### Assigned to

If a Document requires some action from a particular user, you can assign that document to that User. On assignment, the user shall be intimated of the same via an email. [Click here](docs/user/manual/en/using-erpnext/assignment.html) to learn more about this feature.

E.g., an incoming [Lead](/docs/user/manual/en/CRM/lead) can e assigned to a particular user to ensure that the same is being pursued by them.
