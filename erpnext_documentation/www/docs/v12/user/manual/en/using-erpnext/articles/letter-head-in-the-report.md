In a Company master, if no Letter Head is set as default, then in the reports, Letter Head having Default field checked will be fetched.

If you are managing multiple companies in a single ERPNext account, then ensure that for each Company, default Letter Head is set in the Company master.

After updating Letter Head in the Company master, refresh your ERPNext account, and then check the print format of a report.
