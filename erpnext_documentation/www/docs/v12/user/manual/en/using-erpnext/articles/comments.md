## Using Comments

While making any comment on a document, a User can tag any other user. The latter would get a notification in their ERPNext account, saying they have been tagged in a comment.

A user can also comment on any document to intimate other users about a particular detail in a document or a transaction.

## Comment List

As soon as a New Comment is added anywhere in the system, it will be saved in the comment list. This list will also carry other notes in a document like version changes, assignments or tags etc.
