# Using ERPNext

In any organization, it is very important to ensure transparency and accountability towards transactions and operations. To facilitate the same, there is a need to have ease of communication across teams and discussions, and for assignments and feedbacks to have minimal turn-round time.

Taking this concept into an ERP system, we have designed a bunch of tools whereby you can Assign transactions,
manage your To Dos, share and maintain a Calendar, maintain a company-wise Knowledge Base, Tag and Comment on transactions and send your Orders, Invoices
etc via Email. You can also send instant messages to other users using the
Messaging tool.

These tools are integrated into all aspects of the product so that you can
effectively manage your data and collaborate with your co-workers.
