# Set Precision

In ERPNext, default precision for **Float**, **Currency** and **Percent** field is three. It allows you to enter value having value upto three decimal places.

You can also change/customize the precision settings globally or for a specific field.

To change the precision globally, go to:

> Home > Settings > System Settings

Alternatively, you can also set field specific precision. To do that go to [Customize Form](/docs/user/manual/en/customize-erpnext/customize-form)  and select the DocType there. Then go to the specific field row and change precision. Precision field is only visible if field-type is one of the Float, Currency and Percent.
