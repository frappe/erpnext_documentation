# Search Record by Specific Field

While creating any DocType, you may want to link a particular field to another DocType. For ease in selection, you can also ensure that you are able to see the value of another field of the latter DocType in the search result.

Let's assume that you want to see that Item in a Sales Order along with its Item Group. The steps to do this are given below:

#### Step 1: Go to Customize Form

> Home > Customization > Form Customization > Customize Form

#### Step 2: Select the Document for which you want multiple fields to be visible in the Search Field

Here, we will select the Document Item.

#### Step 3:  Search Field

Update Warehouse field name in the Search By field.

Once these settings have been updated, while creating a Sales Order, when you select the Item, you will also be able to the warehouse there.
