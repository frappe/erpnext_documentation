This video walks you through purchase cycle in ERPNext. Purchase Order can be created directly, or by fetching data from Material Request or Supplier Quotation. When ordered items are received from Supplier, Purchase Receipt is created against Purchase Order. You can create Purchase Invoice from Purchase Order or Purchase Receipt. When making payment to Supplier, Journal Entry will be created against Purchase Invoice.
