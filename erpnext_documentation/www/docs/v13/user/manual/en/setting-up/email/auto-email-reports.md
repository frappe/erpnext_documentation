For example, if the email is on the report 'Project Billing Summary' select the Project. The date range here is the date range of the 'Project Billing Summary'.

A message can also be added to be sent with the email report. For example, 'This is your monthly Project Billing Summary Report:'

You can also change the file format in which the report is created. The available options are HTML, XLSX, and CSV.
