On activation of 2FA from setup, it is also activated for the Role "All". In this way, all users including the Administrator have to perform a 2nd level authentication with a token. By unchecking the "Two Factor Authentication" checkbox in the "All" role and enabling it in other roles, the need to login with a token can be limited to specific roles. 2FA does not apply to login by Web Users and API login

When the new user tries to log in for the first time in a system that has two-factor authentication enabled and which has the authentication option as OTP App, an email is sent containing a link to the QR Code.

Scanning the QR Code with an authentication app like Google Authenticator registers the access for the user and automatically starts to generate tokens that can be used to login
