#4. How Stock Reconciliation Works

Once a stock reconciliation is posted to update the quantity on specific date and time for an item in a warehouse, it will not be modified by subsequent stock transactions even if such transactions have a posting date which is prior to the stock reconciliation date.

Examples are as follows

##4.1 For Non-serialized Items
Consider an item with code 'ABC001' in a 'Mumbai' warehouse.
Let's assume that stock as on 10th January is 100 units.
Stock Reconciliation is made on 12th January to set stock balance to 150 units.

Stock Ledger would look as shown below:
<html>
<style>
    td {
    padding:5px 10px 5px 5px;
    };
    img {
    align:center;
    };
	table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
    border-collapse: collapse;
	}
</style>
 <table border="1" cellspacing="0px">
            <tbody>
                <tr align="center" bgcolor="#EEE">
                    <td><b>Posting Date</b>
                    </td>
                    <td><b>Qty</b>
                    </td>
                    <td><b>Balance Qty</b>
                    </td>
                    <td><b>Voucher Type</b>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>10/01/2014</td>
                    <td align="center">100</td>
                    <td>100&nbsp;</td>
                    <td>Purchase Receipt</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>12/01/2014</td>
                    <td align="center">50</td>
                    <td>150</td>
                    <td>Stock Reconciliation</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
</html>

If a new Purchase Receipt entry is made on 5th January, 2014, which is prior to the date of Stock Reconciliation entry, Stock Ledger would look as shown below.
<html>
	<table border="1" cellspacing="0px">
        <tbody>
            <tr align="center" bgcolor="#EEE">
                <td><b>Posting Date</b></td>
                <td><b>Qty</b></td>
                <td><b>Balance Qty</b></td>
                <td><b>Voucher Type</b></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>05/01/2014</td>
                <td align="center">20</td>
                <td style="text-align: center;">20</td>
                <td>Purchase Receipt</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>10/01/2014</td>
                <td align="center">100</td>
                <td style="text-align: center;">120</td>
                <td>Purchase Receipt</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>12/01/2014</td>
                <td align="center"><br></td>
                <td style="text-align: center;"><b>150</b></td>
                <td>Stock Reconciliation<br></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
	</table>
</html>

As you can see, the Balance Qty as on 10th January got updated from 100 to 120. But the Balance Qty as on 12th January did not get updated from 150 to 170.

##4.2 For Serialized Items

For item ITEM-00225 has the 6 serial nos HJF00020, HJF00021, HJF00022, HJF00023, HJF00024, HJF00025 with valuation rate as 496.67 per serial no. At the end of the year user has came to know that they have only 3 serial nos against that item with valuation rate 530. So to remove the old serial nos HJF00020, HJF00021, HJF00022, HJF00023, HJF00024, HJF00025 and add the new serial nos with new valuation rate, stock reconciliation can be use as follows:

Select the item ITEM-00225 in the stock reconciliation, on selection of the item system will auto pull the existing serials nos. Then set qty as 3, valuation rate as 530 and serial no as HJF00026, HJF00027, HJF00028.


<img class="screenshot" alt="Stock Reconciliation" src="{{docs_base_url}}/v13/assets/img/setup/stock-recon-for-serialized.png">

Before reconciliation, the valuation rate was 530 and available qty was 6, so the total stock value was 3,180. After reconciliation, the valuation rate has changed to 620 and available qty changed to 3, so the new stock value becomes 1,860. To adjust the stock value in the accounting, the system has credited extra amount 3,180 - 1,860 = 1,320 to warehouse's account and debited to stock adjustment account. The GL entries for the above entry is as follows:

##4.3 For Batch Items

Stock reconciliation for batch items will be used to add a new batch or to update the quantity of the existing batch. For example, the batch JHGJH00003 has the current quantity as 60 but if the user wants to make it 100 then by using stock reconciliation, user can update the batch quantity.
