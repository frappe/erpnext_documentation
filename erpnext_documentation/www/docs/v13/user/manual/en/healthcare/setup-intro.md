# Setup

Setting up the Healthcare domain is fairly easy. Once you setup ERPNext (Company, Chart Of Accounts etc.), you can start with setting up your domain. To setup Healthcare module completely, you should have `Healthcare Administrator` Role enabled. You can configure each of the departments as detailed in the Setup section.
