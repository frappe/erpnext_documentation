# Keyboard Shortcuts

**ERPNext Version 12 is almost fully accessible using keyboard shortcuts.**

## Keyboard Shortcuts Dialog

The keyboard shortcuts for any page can be viewed by opening the keyboard shortcuts dialog from the Help dropdown on the navigation bar.

The dialog displays a list of global shortcuts that can be used over the entire app. It also displays a list of shortcuts that are specific to the current page.

## Using Alt for Shortcuts

Similar to the pattern used by Windows, Alt is an important key for keyboard shortcuts on ERPNext. Pressing Alt on any page underlines a single character on the Page Menu buttons as well as the buttons on the sidebar. Pressing the underlined character while keeping Alt pressed triggers the button click.

Here, N on the New button is underlined, so pressing Alt + N opens the New Customer dialog:

For the Menu drop-down, a single character on each drop-down item is underlined. So when the Menu is open, the items in the Menu can be clicked by pressing the underlined character while keeping Alt pressed:

##List View

As specified in the Keyboard Shortcuts Dialog, List View is navigable using the *Up* and *Down* arrow keys. *Enter* opens the list item and *Space* selects the list item. *Shift* + *Down* or *Shift* + *Up* can be used to select multiple list items.
