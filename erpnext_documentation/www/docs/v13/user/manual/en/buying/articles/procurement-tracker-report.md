#Procurement Tracker Report

This report lists all the transactions related to goods that are currently in the process of procurement.

To access this report, go to:

> Home > Buying > Procurement Tracker

The procurement tracker allows a user to monitor the process of obtaining goods. It provides information about the user requesting the purchase, the warehouse it was requested from, along with the quantity of the requested item. It also provides a comparison between the estimated cost of the goods at the time of requisition versus actual cost of obtaining them along with the date at which the goods where obtained. This ensures reviewing, ordering, delivery, and billing management for goods involved in the procurement process.
