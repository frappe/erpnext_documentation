#Donor

A donor in general is a person, organization or government who donates something voluntarily. The term is usually used to represent a form of pure altruism but sometimes used when the payment for a service is recognized by all parties as representing less than the value of the donation and that the motivation is altruistic. In business law, a donor is someone who is giving the gift (law), and a donee the person receiving the gift.
