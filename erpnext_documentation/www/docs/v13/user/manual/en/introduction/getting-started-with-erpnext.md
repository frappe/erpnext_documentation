# Getting Started with ERPNext

There are many ways to get started with ERPNext.

### 1\. See the Demo

If you want to check out the user interface and **feel** the application, just
see the demo at:

  * <https://demo.erpnext.com>

### 2\. Start a Free Account at ERPNext.com


ERPNext.com is managed by the organization (Frappe) that publishes ERPNext.
You can start with your own account by [signing up on the
website](https://erpnext.com).

You can also decide to host your application at erpnext.com by buying the
hosting plans. This way you support the organization that develops and
improves ERPNext. You also get one-to-one functional (usage) support with the
hosting plans.

### 3\. Download a Virtual Machine

To avoid the trouble of installing an instance, ERPNext is available as a
Virtual Image (a full loaded operating system with ERPNext installed). You can
use this on **any** platform including Microsoft Windows.

[Instructions on how to use the Virtual Image](https://erpnext.com/download)

### 4\. Install ERPNext on your Unix/Linux/Mac machine

If you are familiar with installing applications on *nix platforms, read the instructions on how to install using [Frappe Bench](https://github.com/frappe/bench).
