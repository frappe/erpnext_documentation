### 2. Setting up GSTIN

GST Law requires that you maintain the GSTIN number for all your suppliers and vendors. In ERPNext, GSTIN is linked to the **Address**

![GSTIN in Customer](/docs/v13/assets/img/regional/india/gstin-customer.gif)

**GST for your Company Address**

You also need to set the Address for your own Company and your Company's GST Number

Go to the Company master and add the GSTIN to your default address.

![GST in Company](/docs/v13/assets/img/regional/india/gstin-company.gif)

**Include GSTIN number in the Address Template**

Open Address Template record for India, add GSTIN number and State Code there if not exists.

### 3. Setting up HSN Codes

According to the GST Law, your itemised invoices must contain the HSN Code related to that Item. ERPNext comes pre-installed with all 12,000+ HSN Codes so that you can easily select the relevant HSN Code in your Item

### 4. Making Tax Masters

To setup Billing in GST, you need to create 3 Tax Accounts for the various GST reporting heads CGST - Central GST, SGST - State GST, IGST - Inter-state GST

Go to your **Chart of Accounts**, under the Duties and Taxes head of your account, create 3 Accounts

**Note:** Usually the rate in CGST and SGST is half of IGST. For example if most of your items are billed at 18%, then create IGST at 18%, CGST and SGST at 9% each.
