# Selling an Asset

To sell an asset, open the asset record and clicking on the **Sell Asset** button. This will take you to a [Sales Invoice](/docs/v13/user/manual/en/accounts/sales-invoice). In the Sales Invoice, enter details like Customer and Payment Due Date.

On submission of the Sales Invoice, following accounting entries will take place:

- "Receivable Account" (Debtors) will be debited by the sales amount.
- "Fixed Asset Account" will be credited by the purchase amount of asset.
- "Accumulated Depreciation Account" will be debited by the total depreciated amount till now.
- "Gain/Loss Account on Asset Disposal" will be credited/debited based on gain/loss amount. The Gain/Loss account can be set in Company record.
