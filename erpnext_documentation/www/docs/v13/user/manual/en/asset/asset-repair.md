### 2.1 Additional options when creating an Asset Repair 

* **Capitalize Repair Cost**: If checked, the Repair Cost will be added to the Asset's value. This could also allow you to increase the Asset's life.
* **Increase In Asset Life(Months)**: The number of months by which the Asset's life might be extended by the repair can be added here. This will modify the Depreciation Schedule of the Asset. This field will only be visible if Capitalize Repair Cost is checked.

* **Stock Consumed During Repair**: Checking this will allow you to make a note of all the Stock Items consumed during the repair.
* **Warehouse**: The Warehouse from which the Stock Items consumed during the repair were taken should be entered here, if Stock Consumed During Repair is checked.
* **Stock Items**: Entering Stock Items consumed during the repair here will create a Stock Entry record of type Material Issue for them, thereby decreasing their quantity. GL Entries will also be created for each Item in the table. This table will only be visible if Stock Consumed During Repair is checked.
