# Land Unit

Before we do anything, we need to define some details about where our crops will be planted. We will first create our farm as a parent land unit, and then we will add one or more fields as children or nodes, belonging to the parent.

> Agriculture > Land Unit

On the desk, click on the Land Unit icon. assets/img/new-land-unit-icon.png A list will show any existing Land Units.

On the top right, click on New  to create the first Land Unit.

* Land Unit Name: Carrot Farm
* Parent Land Unit: All Land Units
* Check the box next to 'Is Group'
* Location: plot the area as you please

Click Save

It should look something like this
