# Payment Terms

Sometimes payment is not done all at once. Depending on the agreement, half of the payment may be made before shipment and the other half after receiving the goods/services. You can add a Payment Terms template or add the terms manually in this section. Read [Payment Terms](/docs/v13/user/manual/en/accounts/payment-terms) to know more.
