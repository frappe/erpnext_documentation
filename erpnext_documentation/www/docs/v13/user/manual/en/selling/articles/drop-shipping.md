#Drop Ship

**Drop shipping** is a supply chain management technique in which the retailer does not keep goods in stock. Instead they transfer customer orders and shipment details to either the manufacturer, another retailer, or a wholesaler, who then ships the goods directly to the customer

In ERPNext, you can create a Drop Shipping by creating Purchase Order against Sales Order.

> Selling > Documents > Sales Order > Purchase Order

#### Setup on Item Master

Set **_Delivered by Supplier (Drop Ship)_** and **_Default Supplier_** in Item Master.

#### Setup on Sales Order
If Drop Shipping has set on Item master, it will automatically set **Supplier delivers to Customer** and **Supplier** on Sales Order Item.

You can setup Drop Shipping, on Sales Order Item. Under **Drop Ship** section, set **Supplier delivers to Customer** and select **Supplier** agaist which Purchase Order will get created.
