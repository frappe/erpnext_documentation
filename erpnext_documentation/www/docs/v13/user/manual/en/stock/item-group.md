# Item Group

**An Item Group is a way to classify items based on types.**

Depending on the type of product, you can categorize an item under its respective field. If the product is
service-oriented, assign it under the Item Group - service. If the
product is used as a raw-material, assign it under the Raw Material
category. In case, an item is used only in trading, you can categorize it
under an Item Group called Trading.

To access the Item Group list, go to:
> Home > Stock > Items and Pricing > Item Group
