# Retaining Sample Stock

**Sample stock is a batch of any Items stored for analyzing should the need arise later.**

The Item for which sample stock is stored can be raw material, packaging material, or finished product.

## 1. Prerequisites
Before using sample retention, it is advised that you create the following first:

* [Item](/docs/v13/user/manual/en/stock/item)
* [Batch](/docs/v13/user/manual/en/stock/batch)
* [Warehouse](/docs/v13/user/manual/en/stock/warehouse)

## 1. How to Set Sample Retention Warehouse in Stock Settings

It is advised to create a new Warehouse separately for retaining samples and not use it in production.

### 1.2 Enable Retain Sample in Item master
Retain Sample is based on Batch hence Has Batch No should be enabled first. Check Retain Sample and set the Maximum allowed samples for a batch.

### 1.3 Make Stock Entry

* Whenever a [Stock Entry](/docs/v13/user/manual/en/stock/stock-entry) is created with the purpose as Material Receipt, for items which have Retain Sample enabled, the Sample Quantity can be set during that Stock Entry. You need to select the Batch Number for the Item/Items. Sample quantity cannot be more than the Maximum sample quantity set in Item Master.
