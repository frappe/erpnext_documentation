It reflects the sum of amounts debited to the COGS account between the dates
*01-01-2021* and *28-06-2021*. Since *Eatables* is an Item Group with
sub-groups such as *Salty* under it, it has two rows assigned. Row 7 with
amount *₹ 4,000.00* shows the amount  debited due to items having the Item Group
set as *Eatables* and row 6 with amount *₹ 4,160.00* is a sum of row 7 and row
8.

The values in the COGS By Item Group Report can be also be referred to in the
**General Ledger** by setting the *Account* filter to the Cost of Goods Sold
account.
