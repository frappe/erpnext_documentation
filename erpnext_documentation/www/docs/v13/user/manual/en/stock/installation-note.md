# Installation Note

**An Installation Note can be created when a product/item is being installed or set up at the Customer's place.**

For example, if you sell an Air Conditioner, a service person generally accompanies the delivery to install the Air Conditioner at the Customer’s place. The service person can create an “Installation Note”, to track the date and details of the installation.

To access the Installation Note list, go to:
> Home > Stock > Serial No and Batch > Installation Note
