## 3. Features

### 3.1 Online Application via a Web Form

A Student Applicant gets automatically created when a student applies online. This can be made possible through the Student Applicant Web Form which is created by default in the system. Search for "[Web Form List](/docs/user/manual/en/website/web-form)" in the awesome bar to access the list of all the web forms in the system.

Once the student applies, the status of the application by default is "Applied". You can either "Approve" or "Reject" the form.

Once the application is approved, you can "Enroll" the student to a program. When you click the **Enroll** button, the system shall create a student against that applicant and redirect you to the [Program Enrollment form](/docs/user/manual/en/education/program-enrollment).

> Note: Once a student is created against the student applicant, the system will set the application status to 'Admitted' and will not allow you to change the application status unless the student record is deleted.
