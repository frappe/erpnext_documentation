### 2.2 Address Title

If the address is not linked to any entity you need to manually add a title.

If the address is linked to an entity like a customer or supplier, the title is generated automatically in 'Entity Name-Address Type' format.

You can also add addresses of your own company's facilities. Check 'Is Your Company Address', select Company in Link DocType, and Company Name in Link Name for such addresses and you can select them in GST Sales Invoice to print your own address.

>GSTIN is to be added in Address and not in Customer/Supplier, as one Customer/Supplier may have multiple GSTIN (one for each state where he conducts his business).
