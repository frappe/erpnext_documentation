# Difference between Lead, Contact, and Customer

* **Lead**: is a potential Customer, someone who can give you business.

* **Customer**: is an individual or organization who has given you business.

* **Contact**: is a person who belongs to the Customer. This is applicable in business-to-business scenario, where you may contact multiple individuals belonging to the same customer.

A Lead can be converted to a Customer by selecting “Customer” from the **Make**
dropdown. Once the Customer is created, the Lead becomes “Converted” and any
further Opportunities from the same source can be created against this
Customer.
