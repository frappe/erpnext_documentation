# Project and Managing Expenses

Employees working on a Project incur various expenses, sometimes from their pockets and then can claim such expenses using [Expense Claim](/docs/v13/user/manual/en/human-resources/expense-claim).

While filling up the claim, they can specify the Project for which they have made the expense.

Based on the Expense Claims made for a particular project, total Expense Claim Amount is updated in the Project master, under project costing section.
