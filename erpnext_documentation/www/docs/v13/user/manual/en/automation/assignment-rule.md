# Assignment Rule

> Introduced in Version 12

**An Assignment Rule lets you set up automatic assignment of documents to Users.**

To assign the support tickets automatically amongst the employees who work on support, an Assignment Rule can be used.

To access Assignment Rule, go to:
> Home > Settings > Assignment Rule

## 1. How to create an Assignment Rule
To set up an automatic assignment:

1. Go to the Assignment Rule list, click on New.
1. Select the Document Type you want to assign automatically (for example **Issue**).
1. Write the "Description" that will be added to the To Do.
1. Select the condition for the assignment.
    You can write simple Python expressions for automatic assignment in the `Assign Rule`, `Close Rule` and `Unassign Rule`. You will have access to all the properties of the document and can use operators like >, <, ==, etc and also multiple conditions like `and` and `or`.

    Examples:

    - `status == "Open"`
    - `issue_type == "Technical" and priority=="High" and status == "Open"`

1. Select the assignment rule.

    * **Round Robin**: Assign each document to a User in sequence.
    * **Load Balancing**: Assign new documents to the User who has the least number of assignments.

        Select the list of Users to whom this Assignment Rule will apply:

    * **Based on Field**: Introduced in v13, this rule can be used to assign a document to the User that is set in the configured field.

        Select the User link field which will determine to whom this Assignment Rule will apply:

1. Save.

You can use properties of the document in the Description field that will be part of the assignment. Higher 'Priority' Assignment Rules will be applied first.

Example:

High Priority Issue *File Upload not working* has been assigned to you.

### 1.1 Multiple Assignment Rules

You can also set up multiple auto assignments for each Document Type, the one with the highest Priority will be applied first.

### 1.2 Setting Due Date for assignment

You can auto set due dates for assignments based on the date field in the reference document.

Example:

If you want to set a due date on Issue assignment based on the "Resolution By" date of the Issue, you can do so by selecting "Resolution By" field in `Due Date Based On` option in Assignment Rule.

![Due Date Based On](/docs/v13/assets/img/automation/assignment-rule-due-date-based-on.png)

**Note:**

- "Due Date Based On" option will not be available if "Document Type" is not yet selected or if the selected Document Type does not have any "Date" or "Datetime" field.
- Due Date in the assignment/ToDo will be updated whenever the "Due Date Based On" field value is updated in the reference document.
