# Fiscal Year Creation

New Fiscal Year should be created each year, at the end of the current fiscal year. Creation of new Fiscal Year before its begining has been automated in ERPNext.

Three days prior to the end of the current Fiscal Year, system checks if new Fiscal Year for the incoming year is already created. If not, then system auto-creates new Fiscal Year.
