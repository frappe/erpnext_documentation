# Payment Order

**A Payment Order is an internal document to record bulk payments against Suppliers.**

In big corporations, the decision of making payment to Suppliers is done by someone like the Purchase Manager. The action of making the payments is done by an Accountant (Accounts User).

The Payment Order is the communication between the Purchase Manager and the Account notifying the Accountant to proceed with the Payment.

In ERPNext, using the Payment Order, you can fetch multiple Payment Requests created against a Supplier.
