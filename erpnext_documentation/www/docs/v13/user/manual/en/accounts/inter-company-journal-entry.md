# Inter Company Journal Entry

**An Inter Company Journal Entry is done between organizations that belong to the same group.**

You can create Inter Company Journal Entry if you are making transactions with multiple Companies.
You can select the Accounts which you wish to use in the Inter Company transactions. A possible use case would be a company buying goods on behalf of another company.

Before creating an Inter Company Journal Entry, you need to set up your Chart of accounts.

1. Go to: **Accounts > Company and Accounts > Chart Of Accounts**.
1. Select the Account which you would like to set as an Internal Account for the transaction, and check the 'Inter Company Account' checkbox. This account can now be used for Inter Company Journal Entry transactions. It is recommended to create a new account for inter company transactions.

You need to do the same for all the Companies' Accounts which you want to use for Inter Company Journal Entry transactions.

In case of parent-child companies, when an account is created in the parent company, it gets added in the child company. This works only if you've selected the option to create Chart of Accounts for child Company based on the parent Company.

Inter company Journal Entries are created using the Journal Entry form in ERPNext. To access the Journal Entry list, go to:

> Home > Accounting > Company and Accounts > Journal Entry
