# Share Transfer

**A Share Transfer is the Issue, Transfer, or Purchase of Company shares from one party to another.**

There may be times when you want to change the share structure of your Company; either by adding new Shareholders or by changing the existing proportion of shares between Shareholders. A Share Transfer is the process of transferring existing shares from one person to another; either by sale or gift.

When creating a new Shareholder, they need to be issued shares first. Only then a Folio Number is visible and further transfer can be done using that Shareholder.

To access the Share Transfer list, go to:
> Home > Accounting > Share Management > Share Transfer
