# Product Listing

ERPNext provides a product listing page where your customers can discover your
products. It is enabled by default if you have published Items on your website.

You can go to the product listing by clicking on the **Explore** button on your
homepage or visiting the **/all-products** route. For example,
`https://apple.erpnext.com/all-products`
