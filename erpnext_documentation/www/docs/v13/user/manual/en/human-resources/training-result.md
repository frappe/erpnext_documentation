# Training Result

**After completion of the training event, employee-wise training results can be stored based on the evaluation done by the trainer.**

ERPNext allows you to create training results and share it with the employees with the Training Result doctype.

To access Training Result, go to:

> Home > Human Resources > Training > Training Result


## 1. Prerequisites

* [Training Program](/docs/v13/user/manual/en/human-resources/training-program)
* [Training Event](/docs/v13/user/manual/en/human-resources/training-event)
* [Employee](/docs/v13/user/manual/en/human-resources/employee)


## 2. How to create a Training Result

1. Go to the Training Result list, click on New.

When the Training Result is submitted, all the employees will receive an email notifying them that they must share their feedback via [Training Feedback](/docs/v13/user/manual/en/human-resources/training-feedback). This is also managed via an Email Alert, so you can customize this alert too.


> **Note:** You can also access Training Result directly from the Training Event dashboard.
