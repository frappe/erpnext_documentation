#Setting Up Dropbox Backups

We always recommend customers to maintain backup of their data in ERPNext. The database backup is downloaded in the form of an SQL file. If needed, this SQL file of backup can be restored in the another ERPNext account as well.

You can automate database backup download of your ERPNext account into your Dropbox account.

To setup Dropbox Backup,
> Home > Integrations > Dropbox Settings

##Steps are different for ERPnext managed versions and open-source versions

###ERPnext Managed Version Instructions

####Step 2: Allow Dropbox Access

After setting frequency and updating other details, click on `Allow Dropbox access`. On clicking this button, the Dropbox login page will open in the new tab. This might require you to allow pop-up for your ERPNext account.

####Step 3: Login to Dropbox

Login to your Dropbox account by entering login credentials.

With this, a folder called "ERPNext" will be created in your Dropbox account, and database backup will start to auto-download in it.

 "dropbox_secret_key": "SECRECTKEY"
}
		</code>

</div>

####Step 12: Confirm Backups Work
From the ERPnext Dropbox page, click `Take Backup Now` and then go to you Dropbox files view. You should see a new folder in Dropbox named `Apps` and inside of it your {New App} folder. Inside of it should be backup folders for both files and database.
So for an app named `erpnext`, following are the folder locations:
```
Database files: /Apps/erpnext/database
Public files: /Apps/erpnext/files
Private files: /Apps/erpnext/private/files
```

> **Note**: If the compressed backup size exceeds 1GB (Gigabyte), the system will upload the latest available backup to Dropbox instead of generating a new backup file.
