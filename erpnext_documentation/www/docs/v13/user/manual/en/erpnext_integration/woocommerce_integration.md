# WooCommerce Integration

Using WooCommerce Integration, the system creates Sales Orders in ERPNext for the orders created on WooCommerce using the WooCommerce webhook.

While creating a Sales Order from WooCommerce, if the Customer or Item is missing in ERPNext, the system will create new Customer/Item by using the respective details from WooCommerce order data. It also creates Address linked to the Customer using the shipping details from the order data.

## 1. How to set up WooCommerce?

### 1.1 Generate API Key and API Secret
