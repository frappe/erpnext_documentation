**Valuation Rate:** Item valuation rate is defined based on it's purchase or manufacture value.

For Purchase Item, it is defined based on charges entered in the Purchase Receipt. If you don't have any Purchase Receipt
made for an item or a Stock Reconciliation, then there won't be any Valuation Rate for that item.
