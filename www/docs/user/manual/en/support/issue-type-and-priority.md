# Issue Type

**Issue Type is useful for tagging and classifying Issues.**

Classifying Issues helps in assigning the concerned team members to specific Issues. Examples of Issue Types can be: 'Functional', 'Technical', 'Hardware', etc. So engineers can be assigned to technical or hardware issues and consultants would be assigned to address functional issues.

To access the Issue Type list, go to: 
> Home > Support > Issues > Issue Type

To create an Issue Type, click on New and enter a name for the type. A description can be added.
