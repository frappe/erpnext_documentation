# Grading Scale

**Under Grading Scale, you can define the threshold for the different grades obtained by the students, based on their scores in the assessment.**

For example, Students obtaining a score of 90% and above would be graded as A+, students obtaining a score of 80% and above would be graded A- and so on.
