# BOM Comparison Tool

**Using the BOM Comparison Tool, you can compare two BOMs and see what changed between their iterations.**

A BOM ([Bill of Materials](/docs/user/manual/en/manufacturing/bill-of-materials)) of an Item undergoes several changes over time. When you need to change something in your BOM, you have to Cancel the BOM, Amend it, make
the change and create a new version of the BOM. Now you have two different BOMs and
change history is lost.

The BOM Comparison Tool lets you compare two different BOMs and will show you
what changed between them.

To use the BOM Update Tool, go to:

> Home > Manufacturing > Tools > BOM Comparison Tool
