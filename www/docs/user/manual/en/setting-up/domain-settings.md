# Domain settings

You can select the domains to be active globally under Domain Settings. 

To access Domain Settings, go to:
> Home > Settings > Domain Settings

If a domain is disabled, the following things will happen:

* The domain card will be unavailable on the home page
* The DocTypes related to the domain will no longer be accessible. For example, if you disable the Education module, Student and other DocTypes in Education will not be accessible.
