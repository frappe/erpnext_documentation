# Workflow State

**A Workflow State is a state in the workflow you create.**

Different Workflow States may be achieved before or after applying different Workflow Actions on them. If you want to create a Workflow where there are multiple approvals from manager, senior manager, general manager, etc, you can set the states for it from Workflow States.

By default, the following Workflow States are created in ERPNext:

The Workflow States can have different colors according to the state.

* Success - Green
* Danger - Red
* Inverse - Black
* Primary - Dark Blue
* Info - Light Blue
* Warning - Orange

Document statuses:

* Saved = 0
* Submitted = 1
* Canceled = 3
