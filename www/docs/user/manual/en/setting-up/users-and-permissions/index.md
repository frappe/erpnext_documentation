# Users And Permissions

In ERPNext, you can create multiple users and assign them different roles.

A role is a set of permissions assigned to a user so that they can access the documents they need to. For example, a sales employee will need access to sales transactions but will not have access to approve leaves. 

Some users can only access the public-facing part of ERPNext (i.e. a portal view). Such users are called "Website Users". "System Users" will have access to modules and can access documents as per the roles set.

ERPNext implements permission control at the User and Role level. Each user in the system can be assigned multiple roles and permissions. The most important role is "System Manager". Any user having this role can add other users and set roles for all users.
