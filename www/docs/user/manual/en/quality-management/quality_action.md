# Quality Action

> Introduced in Version 12

**A Quality Action is taken on a Quality Review to correct unsatisfactory results or prevent them from happening.**

Quality Action is a standard feature to allow implementation of corrective and preventive actions. This will meet compliance with industry regulations including GMP, ISO 9001 and 14001, TSCA, REACH, etc.

Quality Action workflows provide a controlled environment and reduce the risk of repeat issues by ensuring that defined solutions and processes are met.

Quality Actions can be initialized for a Quality Goal or for a Customer Feedback which may not meet the expected quality standards. Depending on that a Corrective or Preventive Action can be started.
