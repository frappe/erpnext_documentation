# Training Result

**After completion of the training event, employee-wise training results can be stored based on the evaluation done by the trainer.**

ERPNext allows you to create training results and share it with the employees with the Training Result doctype.

* [Training Event](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/training-event)
* [Employee](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/employee)

When the Training Result is submitted, all the employees will receive an email notifying them that they must share their feedback via [Training Feedback](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/training-feedback). This is also managed via an Email Alert, so you can customize this alert too.


> **Note:** You can also access Training Result directly from the Training Event dashboard.
