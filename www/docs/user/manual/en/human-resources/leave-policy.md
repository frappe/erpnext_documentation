# Leave Policy

**The amount of entitled leaves in a Company for a Leave Period is known as Leave Policy.** 

It is a practice for many enterprises to enforce a general Leave Policy to effectively track and manage Employee leaves. ERPNext allows you to create and manage multiple Leave Policies and allocate leaves to Employees as defined by the policy.

To access Leave Policy, go to:

> Home > Human Resources > Leaves > Leave Policy 

## 1. How to create a Leave Policy

Once submitted, you can  enforce the Leave Policy through the dashboard either to an Employee or an Employee Grade. 

When the Leave Policy is assigned to an [Employee Grade](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/employee-grade), it will ensure that all leave allocations for employees of this grade will be as per the Leave Policy. In case you need to selectively update the Leave Policy for a particular Employee, you can do so by updating the [Employee](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/employee) master.
