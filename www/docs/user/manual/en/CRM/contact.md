To access the Contact list, go to:
> Home > CRM > Sales Pipeline > Contact

1. Enter First Name and Last Name.
2. Choose the status if the contact is passive, is open to contact or has replied.
3. Enter contact details like email, phone, etc.
4. Save.

When you have multiple contacts against an entity like customer/supplier, you can check 'Is Primary Contact' to indicate the preferred contact. The primary contact will be chosen automatically in transactions like sales order and sales invoice.

To Import multiple contacts from a spreadsheet, use the [Data Import Tool](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/data/data-import).
