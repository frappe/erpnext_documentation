# Quality Feedback

**Quality Feedback is the information that a Customer expresses about the satisfaction or dissatisfaction about the products or services you offer.**

Quality Feedback has different fields to rate different parameters. The Customer/User can easily give their feedback by selecting their template to rate on different parameters and also provide qualitative feedback on these parameters.

You can also fetch the parameters using a [Quality Feedback Template](/docs/user/manual/en/quality-management/quality-feedback-template). The templates store preset information for you to select in the Quality Feedback.

If the Feedback is not as per expectations, a Quality Action may be initialized on the basis of the seriousness of the Feedback.

To access Quality Feedback, go to:
> Home > Quality > Feedback > Quality Feedback
