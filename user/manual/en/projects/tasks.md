### 1.1 Additional Options while creating a Project

The following additional details can be added when editing a new task:

  * **Status**: You can add the status of the Project or change the same whenever needed, e.g., from 'Open' to 'Working', 'Overdue','Pending Review','Completed', or 'Cancelled'
  * **Project**: In case a task is added independently, you may choose to link the task to a particular Project. If the task is created from a Project, the details of the Project will get auto-imported.
  * **Priority**: You can choose to define the priority of the task, viz., Low, Medium, High or Urgent.
  * **Issue**: If the task is an actionable that arises out of an Issue, that issue can be tagged here with the Task.
  * **Weight**: If a particular task carries some weightage out of a project, or otherwise, the weightage can be specified here. This weightage gets calculated in the Percentage Task Completion Method by Task Weight.
  * **Type**: If your task can be defined under a particular Task Type, say, User Training or User Demo, you can enter the Task Type here. It can be used to filter the Tasks based on Task Types.
  * **Color**: Each task can be recognized with a different color. This helps in identification of the task, while creating Gantt Charts.
  * **Is Group**: This box can be checked to indicate that a task is a parent task, and can be further divided into multiple sub-tasks.
  * **Parent Task**: If a particular task is a part of a group task, the parent task can be linked to the task from this field.
