# Project Template

A Project Template is a set of tasks that can automatically be populated for a new project. In the task, you can define the number of days from the project start date and the duration of each task.

This is ideal for projects that have standardized tasks (like an ERP implementation project).

> Added in Version 12

### Usage

##### Step 1: Make a Project Template with the standard Tasks

<img class="screenshot" alt="Project Template" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/project/project-template.png">

##### Step 2: Make a Project from the Project Template

<img class="screenshot" alt="Project from Project Template" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/project/project-template-project.png">

Templated projects can be created from the **Project Template** or in the Project itself by setting the "Project Template" field for an empty task list.
