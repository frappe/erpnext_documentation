# Website

Websites are a core component of any business. Having a good website usually
means running into obstacles like investing a lot of money, difficult to update,
and it not being interactive.

If you're not a web designer yourself, wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to
update the product catalog on your site automatically from your ERP? We thought
exactly the same thing and hence built a small Website module right inside
ERPNext! Using this module, you can:

- Create Web Pages
- Write Blogs
- Publish your Product Catalog using the Item master
- Allow users to buy your products using the Shopping Cart

Though not necessary, to make a good website, you might have to know a bit of
HTML/CSS or hire the services of a professional. The good part is that once this
is set up, you can add and edit content, blogs, and products directly from your
ERPNext account.

You can check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyW6mfFBSNw)
for a demonstration of the Website module in ERPNext.
