# Attendance

An Attendance record stating that an Employee has been present on a particular
day can be created manually by:

> Human Resources > Documents > Attendance > New Attendance

You can get a monthly report of your Attendance data by going to the _Monthly
Attendance Details_ report.

You can easily set attendance for Employees using the [Employee Attendance Tool](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/employee-attendance-tool)

You can also bulk upload attendance using the [Upload Attendance Tool](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/upload-attendance)

It is also, possible to setup marking of attendance automatically based on check-in/check-out logs from Biometric/RFID Devices (or any other similar mechanisms the produce IN/OUT logs of the employee). Please refer to [Auto Attendance](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/auto-attendance) feature for more information.
