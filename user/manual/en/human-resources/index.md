# Human Resources

The Human Resources (HR) module covers the processes related to the HR department of a company. Most important feature here is processing the payroll by using
Payroll Entry to generate Salary Slips. Most countries have complex tax
rules stating which expenses the company can make on behalf of its Employees.
There are a set of rules for the company to deduct taxes and social security
from employee payroll. ERPNext accommodates all types of taxes and
their calculation.

It also maintains a complete employee database including contact information,
salary details, attendance, performance evaluation, leaves, and appraisal records.
