# Salary Structure

**Salary Structure is the details of the salary being offered to an Employee, in terms of breakup of the different components constituting the compensation.**

Any changes to the Salary Structure i.e. among the components, can have a major impact on what the Employee does, such as the kind of tax exemptions claimed. 

ERPNExt allows you to define the Earning and Deductions of a Salary Structure, Payroll frequency and Payment Mode among other features.

To access Salary Structure, go to:
> Home > Human Resources > Payroll > Salary Structure

## 1. How to create a Salary Structure

To create a new Salary Structure:

1. Go to: Salary Structure > New.
2. Enter the Salary Structure Name.
3. Select the Company Name and Payroll Frequency.
3. Save and Submit.


## 2. Features

Apart from the mandatory fields, the other important fields of a Salary Structure are Earnings and Deductions which form the basis of the Salary Structure among others. They are explained below:

### 1. Earning and Deduction

Earnings specify the Salary Components that are earned by an Employee. These components typically include basic, allowances, bonuses and incentives that are added to the employee's Total Salary. On the other hand, Deductions specify the Salary Components that are deducted from the employee's Total Salary. These typically include the taxes. 


To create Earnings and Deductions, select the Salary Component in the Component column. Enter the Formula/Condition if not previously specified while creating the [Salary Component](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/salary-component). Additionally, you can also enter a pre-defiend amount in the Amount column.
