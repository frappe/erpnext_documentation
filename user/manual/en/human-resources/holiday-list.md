> **Note:** Each time a new holiday is updated in the Holidays table, the Total Holidays field gets updated.


### 2.2 Holiday List in Employee 

If you have created multiple Holiday List, select a specific Holiday List for an Employee in the respective master.

When an Employee applies for Leave, the days mentioned in the Holiday List will not be counted, as they are holidays already. 



> **Note:** If you have specified a Holiday List in the Employee master, then that Holiday List will be given priority as compared to the default Holiday List of the Company.
You can form as many holiday lists as you wish. For example, if you have a factory, you can have one list for the factory workers and another list for office staff. You can manage between many lists by linking a Holiday List to the respective Employee.

You can also access [Company](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/company-setup), [Employee](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/employee), [Workstation](/docs/user/manual/en/manufacturing/workstation), [Service Level](/docs/user/manual/en/support/service-level), [Service Level Agreement](/docs/user/manual/en/support/service-level-agreement), [Leave Period](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/leave-period), and [Shift Type](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/shift-type) from the Holiday List page.
