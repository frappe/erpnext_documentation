# Document Versioning

**In ERPNext, Document Versioning is a feature that allows you to track all the changes made in a form or a document.**

This feature is comes handy while conducting an Audit Tail to check on what changes were made in a document along with the time of change and the stakeholder responsible.

## How to Enable Document Versioning

Let's assume that we need to enable Dcoument Versioning for Purchase Order.

1. Go to Purchase Order List.
2. Click on Customize from the drop-down menu.
3. You shall be directed to the [Customize Form](/docs/user/manual/en/customize-erpnext/customize-form) page for Purchase Order.
4. Check the field "Track changes" in the Properties.

With this, Document Versioning shall be enabled for all the Purchase Orders edited henceforth.

### Version Log

For each document that has Document Versioning enabled, a Version Log is created. Herein, there will be links to specific versions of the document.

When you click on these links, you will be directed to a log of all the fields and the changes made therein.
