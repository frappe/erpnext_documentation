`For hosted users, limit of 5 MB is applied on file size.`

Attachment of too many files to documents may affect the performance of your ERPNext account. You can set a limit towards the maximum number of attachments that can be added to a document. Click [here](/docs/user/manual/en/customize-erpnext/articles/changing-attachment-limits) to learn more about it.

## File Manager

All the files attached to any of the documents in your account are listed in the File Manager. You can access the same by:

Home > Tools > Files
