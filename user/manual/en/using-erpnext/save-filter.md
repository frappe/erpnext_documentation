Let's say, in purchase orders, you need to search for all the purchase orders where the Grand Total is more than ₹ 10000. However, as we know, there is no filter which is present for it out of the box. 

In this case, you can create a custom filter for it and save the same condition in the 'Save Filter' option for you to easily access this filter everytime you open the Purchase Order list.

To save a Custom Filter, you may go to the 'Save Filter' option in the Left Sidebar of list or the report.
