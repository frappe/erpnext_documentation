#### 2.5 Create a Supplier Quotation

You may need to get a quotation from your supplier against the customer requirement and based on that, prepare the quotation for your customer. With ERPNext, you can make a [Supplier Quotation](/docs/user/manual/en/buying/supplier-quotation) from the opportunity itself.

> Best Practice: Leads and Opportunities are often referred as your “Sales
Pipeline” this is what you need to track if you want to be able to predict how
much business you are going to get in the future. Its always a good idea to be
able to track what is coming in order to adjust your resources.

#### 2.6 Capture the Reasons for Losing Opportunities

When an opportunity is lost, you can capture the reasons for losing. This will help you to analyse the trends over a long period of time and identify the insights needed for improvements at various areas in the organisation.

#### 2.7 Minutes to First Response

When you send the first reply(email) to an Opportunity, it calculates Mins to First Response and is displayed in a field.

A report is generated called 'Minutes to First Response for Opportunity'. For more details [click here](/docs/user/manual/en/CRM/crm_reports).
