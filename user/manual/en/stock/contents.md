# Stock
The Stock or Inventory module in ERPNext helps you to:

* Maintain details of your products and warehouses.
* Track receipt, transfer and delivery of the products.
* Optimize stock levels by providing real-time information via reports.
* Provide valuation of each product.

The Stock module is tightly integrated with Purchase, Manufacturing and Accounting modules.
