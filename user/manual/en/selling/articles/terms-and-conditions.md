# Terms and Conditions

Each Quotation must ideally contain a set of terms of your contract. Terms and conditions are usually included to define terms of service, conditions for using any service or to even limit responsibilities of the seller in case any harm is caused to the buyer due to using the provided goods or services.  It is

you have a standard set of terms. You can do this by going to:
