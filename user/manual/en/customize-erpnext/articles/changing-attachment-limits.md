#Changing Attachment Limits

In ERPNext, you can limit how many files can be attached to specific Document. Using Custmize Form, you can set **Max(imum) Attachments** which can be added to a particular documents.

Let's assume we need to update Max Attachment for Quotation to five.

#### Step 1: Setup

> Home> Customization > Form Customization > Customize Form

#### Step 2: Select Document Type

<img alt="Select Doctype" class="screenshot" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/customize/customize-increase-max-attachments-1.png">

#### Step 3: Set Limit

Set Maximum Attachments as five.

<img alt="Set Max Attachment" class="screenshot" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/customize/customize-increase-max-attachments.png">

After updating Max Attachments, Update Customize Form. Reload your ERPNext account and then check specific Quotation to confirm if Max Attachment limit is updated.
