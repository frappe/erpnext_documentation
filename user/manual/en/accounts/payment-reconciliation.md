# Payment Reconciliation

**Payment Reconciliation is used to link payments with invoices.**

In complex scenarios, especially in the capital goods industry, sometimes there is no direct link between payments and invoices. You send invoices to your Customers and your Customer sends you block payments or payments based on some schedule that is not linked to your invoices.

In such cases, you can match Payments with Invoices using Payment Reconciliation.

To access Payment Reconciliation, go to:
> Home > Accounts > Banking and Payments > Match Payments with Invoices
