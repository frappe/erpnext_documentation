# Bank

**A Bank is financial institution that stores and manages money.**

In ERPNext, saving different banks lets you upload an excel sheet and map the transactions to the ledger. The transactions are created as Bank Transactions. These can then be used for reference and reports. This is done using [Bank Reconciliation](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts/bank-reconciliation).

To access Bank, go to:
> Home > Accounting > Bank Statement > Bank

Creating a Bank is simple, go to the Bank list, click on New, and enter a name.

## 1.1 Configuring data import for a Bank

1. Under 'Field in Bank Transaction' select the field to be updated in the 'Bank Statement Transaction Entry' form.

On setting this up, [Bank Reconciliation](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts/bank-reconciliation) can be done smoothly.
