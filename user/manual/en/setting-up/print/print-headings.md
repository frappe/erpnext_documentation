# Print Headings

**Print Headings are the names/titles you can give your transactions.**

These transactions include Sales Invoices, Supplier Quotations, etc. You can create a list of names for different business communications.

If you want to rename a transaction on how it appears when printing, you can do so via Print Headings. For example, a Quotation is also called a "Proposal", Estimate", or "Pro Forma Invoice".
