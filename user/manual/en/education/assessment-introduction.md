# Assessment

Every education institute needs to have a well defined assessment procedure to evaluate the students' curricular performance in a period. The complete assessment processing for your institute can be very easily mapped into and managed via ERPNext.

Following is the order in which you should set up masters in the Assessment module.

1. Assessment Criteria
1. Assessment Group
1. Grading Scale

Once you have also defined the Student Group and Courses, you can schedule an assessment/examination by creating Assessment Plan.
Based on the performance of the Student in the assessment, you can create Assessment Result for a Student. You can create Assessment Results in bulk using Assessment Result Tool. In this tool, on the selection of Assessment Plan, all the students (for Student Group) will be fetched. You can quickly enter marks earned by each Student for each Assessment Criteria in a single row.
